This archive-groundwork-monitor/ directory is here in Subversion to
contain the top-level Maven-related build files that we formerly stored
in the top level of our OS repository.  Now that we will draw only from
our PRO repository for our builds, it is necessary to park and maintain
these files somewhere in the PRO repository, and this directory is that
location.  Our build scripting will draw from this place and deposit these
Maven-related files in the proper place within the build structure so they
affect the compiled code in the expected manner, even though there is no
code or further Maven setup underneath this directory within Subversion.
