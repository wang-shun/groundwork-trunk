 aGE("NeDi","NeDi uses SNMP and information container in device CDP, CAM and ARP tables to step from device to device. Along the way it identifies any nodes attached to those devices. Device configurations can also be pulled and stored for comparison between executions of NeDi.  Changes can be communicated to network administrators.    GroundWork Monitor Professional uses data from NeDi to populate the Configuration tool (Monarch) for monitoring using Nagios. Additionally, GroundWork Monitor Professional NMS uses NeDi to support efficient discovery of network devices and nodes.");
 aGE("Net SNMP","Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is a widely used protocol for monitoring the health and welfare of network equipment (eg. routers), computer equipment and even devices like UPSs. GroundWork Monitor SNMP Trap processing uses Net SNMP libraries.");

 aGE("NRPE","Nagios Remote Plugin Executor allow you to execute local plugins on remote hosts.  NRPE is an agent compiled for different platforms.");
 aGE("NSCA","NSCA is an addon for Nagios that is designed to accept passive service check results from clients and pass them along to the Nagios process by using the external command interface. This is useful when implementing redundant and distributed servers.    GroundWork Monitor Professional uses Nagios Service Check Acceptor (NSCA) to listen for passive host and service check results in distributed monitoring configurations. In GroundWork Monitor Professional NSCA is embedded in Bronx, GroundWork's version of the Nagios Event Broker.");
 aGE("Ntop","Ntop is a network traffic probe that shows the network usage, similar to what the popular top UNIX command does.    GroundWork Monitor Professional NMS uses Ntop to analyze and report on network protocol usage patterns.
