The deploy script is installed on the GW machine as:
/etc/fuel/plugins/fuel-plugin-groundwork-monitor-7.1/deploy.sh

The deploy script is properly logging its actions here:
/var/log/fuel-plugin-groundwork-monitor/deployment.log
although the Fuel UI says to look somewhere in "Astute logs".
I have no idea where to look for those.

The deploy script is not obtaining the admin password; it is
empty within the script, despite being present in the
/etc/astute.yaml -> /etc/groundwork_monitor.yaml file:

fuel-plugin-groundwork-monitor:
 postgresql_admin_password: '123'

That's been fixed now.

The password is stored in that file, which is a security problem.
The only saving grace is that the file is owned by root, with
600 permissions.

On the Fuel Master, the password is stored in at least these files:

    /var/log/docker-logs/astute/astute.log
    /var/log/docker-logs/nailgun/api.log
    /var/lib/fuel/container_data/8.0/postgres/data/base/16387/18689
    /var/lib/fuel/container_data/8.0/postgres/data/pg_xlog/000000010000000000000004

But I have to question why PostgreSQL got installed on the Fuel Master,
when it isn't even part of the trial plugin yet.  Apparently, Fuel
uses PostgreSQL.
It can also end up stored here:

/root/.viminfo

if searched for directly in vim.

The BitRock installer does not appear to have been copied
over to the deployed machine.
