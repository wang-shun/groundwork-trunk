On what is apparently the Fuel Master for our Mirantis Lab test environment:

[root@fuel plugins]# hostname
fuel.domain.tld
[root@fuel plugins]# fuel plugins --install /tmp/fuel-plugin-groundwork-monitor-7.1-7.1.0-1.noarch.rpm 
DEPRECATION WARNING: /etc/fuel/client/config.yaml exists and will be used as the source for settings. This behavior is deprecated. Please specify the path to your custom settings file in the FUELCLIENT_CUSTOM_SETTINGS environment variable.
...
Complete!
Plugin /tmp/fuel-plugin-groundwork-monitor-7.1-7.1.0-1.noarch.rpm was successfully installed.

[root@fuel plugins]# cat /etc/fuel/client/config.yaml
SERVER_ADDRESS: "10.20.0.2"
SERVER_PORT: "8000"
KEYSTONE_USER: "admin"
KEYSTONE_PASS: "admin"
KEYSTONE_PORT: "5000"

Partial output from "fuel --help":

            Default configuration for Fuel Client uses the
            following parameters:

            SERVER_ADDRESS: "127.0.0.1"
            LISTEN_PORT: "8000"
            KEYSTONE_USER: "admin"
            KEYSTONE_PASS: "admin"

            These options can be changed by putting some or all of them
            into a yaml-formatted text file and specifying its full path
            in the FUELCLIENT_CUSTOM_SETTINGS environment variable.
