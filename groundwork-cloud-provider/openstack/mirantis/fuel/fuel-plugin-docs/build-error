Bad luck.  Having just the installer emulator script was just fine
for a build.  Adding the BitRock installer itself adds many bytes:

-rwxr-xr-x 827497515 deployment_scripts/groundworkenterprise-7.1.0-br389-gw2838-linux-64-installer.run

and produces:

    fpb --build .
    Unexpected error
    Shell command executed with "1" exit code:
	rpmbuild -vv --nodeps \
	    --define "_topdir /home/anon/fuel-plugin-groundwork-monitor/.build/rpm" \
	    -bb /home/anon/fuel-plugin-groundwork-monitor/.build/rpm/plugin_rpm.spec 

Running that command by hand (since I don't know where fpb redirects
all the "rpmbuild --vv" debug output), I see at the end:

    + /usr/lib/rpm/brp-strip-comment-note /usr/bin/strip /usr/bin/objdump
    /usr/bin/strip: error: the input file '/home/anon/fuel-plugin-groundwork-monitor/

    error: Arch dependent binaries in noarch package

    RPM build errors:
	Arch dependent binaries in noarch package

Well, that's going to make it difficult.  We need some automated way
from within the "fpb --build" run to remove or comment out this line
in the specfile:

    BuildArch:      noarch

to allow binary files to be included in the build.
