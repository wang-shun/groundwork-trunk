Note that it takes a LOT of space to build the plugin, since you will
end up with multiple copies of the GroundWork installer:  one in the
source tree, at least three temporary copies in the _build tree, and
one in the built plugin, of which there might be multiple copies in
the build tree and the final location at the top of the plugin source
code.
