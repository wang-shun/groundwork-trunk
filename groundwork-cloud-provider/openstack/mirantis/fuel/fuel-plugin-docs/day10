Hans,

I spent considerable time this evening running lots of iterations
with the plugin install, making tweaks, and resetting the system
to try again.  In the end, I had the plugin essentially working,
though all these trials have been with my installer emulator,
not the real BitRock installer, for speed of testing turnaround.

The Lab machines, however, were not cooperating.  They eventually
stopped installing OpenStack correctly, and finally all deployment
ground to a total halt.

I took notes as I went, and now have a long list of anomalies --
some of them minor, and some of them quite alarming.  But, this is
(or was) Saturday -- enough work for today!  I'll leave you in
suspense for the moment.

I'll spend time writing up all my notes on Sunday and send them
out to everyone then.

Glenn

Seen in the Fuel UI:

    Error
    Provision has failed. Check these nodes:
    'Untitled (de:e7)', 'Untitled (e4:fa)', 'Untitled (d7:8e)', 'Untitled (ad:ed)', 'Untitled (4e:89)'

See on the Fuel Master, lots of messages similar to these, in the /var/log/monit.log file:

    [UTC May 22 07:33:05] error    : 'rootfs' space usage 19.9% matches resource limit [space usage<90.0%]
    [UTC May 22 07:33:05] info     : 'rootfs' exec: /usr/bin/fuel_notify.py
    [UTC May 22 07:33:05] error    : 'varfs' space usage 38.9% matches resource limit [space usage<90.0%]
    [UTC May 22 07:33:05] info     : 'varfs' exec: /usr/bin/fuel_notify.py

Why are those checks declared to be errors, when they are obviously well under the specified limits?
