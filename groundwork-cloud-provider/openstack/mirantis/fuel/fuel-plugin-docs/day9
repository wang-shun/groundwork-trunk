Hans,

You know most of this already, but I'm repeating it here to make
sure everyone is on the same page.

Today I uploaded the plugin to the Mirantis Labs machines and tested
installing and uninstalling it from the Fuel Master.  That worked
just fine.  However, I found that this Fuel Master was running Fuel
7.0, so I adapted the plugin to say it supports both 7.0 and 8.0
(instead of just 8.0), and downgraded the plugin packaging version
from 4.0.0 to 3.0.0 as was then necessary.  I have no idea exactly
what the difference in package formats is, nor of what we might
give up by insisting on compatibility with the older Fuel release.

Then I tried to move to deploy the plugin to a compute node, but
could find no clear instructions in either the Fuel Plugin SDK
or the Fuel User Guide (version 8.0) for that purpose.  So I have
asked Mirantis for help.  They can see all of my installed plugin
files on the 172.16.1.2 machine, if that helps.

I do not see my plugin listed anywhere in the Fuel web UI, and I
have no clear idea why.  I do see it listed in "fuel plugins --list"
output on the Fuel Master.

Given that I was blocked on that path, I turned to reviewing the
Test-document templates provided by Mirantis:

http://content.mirantis.com/rs/451-RBY-185/images/TestReportforPluginnameFuelPlugin.docx

I scanned through these documents, but it's not clear to me how we
can implement sensible tests for our monitoring plugin, past the fact
that it gets installed and gets deployed in a simple environment.
