Oleksandr,

I'm trying to run a Test Case for the "Fuel create mirror and update
(setup) of core repos" that you have requested.  I get to the step
that involves creating the mirror, and I get:

    [root@fuel tmp]# fuel-createmirror -M
    This script is DEPRECATED. Please use fuel-mirror utility!
    ...
    Packages processed: 1299/1299

    Updating the Cluster repositories...
    Try to update the Cluster 'GroundWork'
    Updating the default repositories...
    Try to update the Release 'Liberty on Ubuntu 14.04'
    400 Client Error: Bad Request

What's the fix here?

Also, in the next step, the Test Plan template mentions <ENV_ID>,
<NODE_ID1>, <NODE_ID2>, and <NODE_IDn> as command parameters.
What are the appropriate values to substitute in the specified
command, and how do I find them?  (This information belongs in that
Test Plan template, as well.)

Finally, what factors control how long it takes to Deploy a cluster?
I just deployed a 6-node cluster from scratch, and it took nearly
two hours.  That seems a bit long.
