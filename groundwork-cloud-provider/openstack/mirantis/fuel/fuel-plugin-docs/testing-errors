While creating an environment, got an ERROR (non-discovered) node (d7:8e);
have no idea how to figure out what failed, and how to clear it.  It did
seem to get cleared when I assigned it some role and deployed the changes.

For a new environment, configure at least:

1 Controller node
1 Storage - Cinder node
1 Telemetry - MongoDB node
1 Compute node


Initial parallel deploy of 5 nodes starts about 12:03.
12:21 ubuntu is installed on 5 nodes
installing openstack on telemetry node first, then on controller.
groundwork finished installing at 13:16

deploy of new cluster starts at 13:56.
14:13 ubuntu is installed on all machines,
14:13 fuel plugin is copied to groundwork machine,
openstack starts on telemetry machine;
14:16 openstack done on telemetry, starting on groundwork;
14:17 openstack done on groundwork ("READY" even though the gw
    plugin is not installed on the node), starting on controller;
15:10 groundwork fully deployed

17:14 pending deletion of gw node

new environment, without gw node:
17:31 begin cluster deployment
18:29 done installing openstack on controller; running on compute and storage nodes
18:33 storage openstack done; still installing openstack on compute node
18:41 install of openstack on the compute node failed, resulting in ERROR status in the node listing
BAD NEWS:  a plugin developer needs to know exactly what logs or other evidence to capture when this sort of failure happens,
to track it down and get it fixed; it would not be acceptable to suffer random failures like this in a production system

Here's one sample message, among many:
2016-07-12 01:41:11 ERR (/Stage[main]/Ceilometer::Client/Package[python-ceilometerclient]/ensure)
    Could not resolve 'mirror.fuel-infra.org'

19:00 compute node re-deployed, completely

first attempt to enable the fuel plugin in an already-deployed environment failed; second attempt succeeded

looking at Fuel Master ERROR messages for RPC Consumer shows lots of problems; this is typical, and does not inspire confidence, but is probably not related to the fuel plugin enablement failure, due to an out-of-date timestamp

19:10 deploy begins of fresh GW node added to an existing deployed environment
19:13 ubuntu is installed; then within a minute, installing openstack on both gw and telemetry nodes
19:15 openstack done on gw and telemetry, both marked READY (though plugin not yet installed on gw;
    installing openstack on fuel master
19:17 openstack done on controller, running on compute and storage nodes (why???)
19:18 all nodes marked READY; gw plugin install begins (as seen by the gw installer scripting
    running on the node itself), but gw node still displays as READY even while this is ongoing,
    and Deploying progress bar is shown as 100%, so both forms of status are highly misleading
19:27 gw install completes

need nuclear-launch-code protections against gw node deletion

Test "Attempt plugin install with corrupted GroundWork installer":

    Complete!
    Plugin /tmp/fuel-plugin-groundwork-monitor-7.1-7.1.0-1.noarch.rpm was successfully installed.

Yet in spite of this, the fuel plugin REMAINS INSTALLED; the
post-install failure is NOT being flagged by the Fuel Plugin
processing as denoting a failure, so it claims a success, and does
not back out the installed RPM.  To see why:

    [root@fuel tmp]# rpm -V fuel-plugin-groundwork-monitor-7.1-7.1.0-1.noarch
    WARNING:  The GroundWork Monitor BitRock installer is not present.
    [root@fuel tmp]# echo $?
    0

So somehow we need to turn the non-fatal post-install failure into a fatal failure.
