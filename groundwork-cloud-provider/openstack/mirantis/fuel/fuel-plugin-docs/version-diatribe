Mirantis has asked that we follow a 6-digit, #.#-#.#.#-# format
for release numbering.  The engineer in me has to ask, what is
the point of this excessive complexity?  I don't know any other
project that standardizes on such a format.  It seems that your
other plugin developers are just cargo-culting (*) this construction,
without trying to make any sense out of it.  People seem to be simply
duplicating various digits in this format, without having any obvious
connection to some outside definition of what each separate digit
is supposed to represent.  For instance, the doc/source/conf.py
file in the midonet-fuel-plugin-4.0-4.0.0-1 plugin contains this
workaround for the complicated release numbering.

    # General information about the project.
    project = u'fuel-midonet-plugin'
    copyright = u'2016, Midokura SARL'
    version = '4.0.0'
    release = version[:3] + '-' + version + '-1'

In the interest of getting our GroundWork plugin quickly past the
Mirantis plugin auditors, I have adopted the same strategy, but I
am doing so under protest, as I can't see that it makes any real
sense.  Perhaps I've forgotten now, but I don't recall seeing any
explanation of this versioning scheme anywhere in the Fuel Plugin
Wiki or the Fuel Plugin Handbook.  But that's not even the point.
Version numbers are there partly to be consumed by users of the
plugins, not just developers.  Whatever convention is being followed
here, where is it described for ordinary end-users so they are aware
of the meaning, and don't just treat it as a string of gobbledegook?

To be constructive about it, I recommend you take a look at the
simple Semantic Versioning convention (http://semver.org).

(*) The term "cargo cult" comes from the book "Surely You're
    Joking, Mr. Feynman!", by Richard P. Feynman, the famous
    physicist.  It's a great book; I highly recommend it.
