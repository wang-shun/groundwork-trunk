.. The |space| definition is here to implement a method whereby a parsed-literal:: block
   can be forced to have its surrounding box suppressed in PDF output.  Such a box will
   appear in the PDF if no substitution occurs inside the block, but it will be suppressed
   if a substitution does appear.  So in parsed-literal:: blocks that already do have some
   substitution in play, this subterfuge is not necessary.  For blocks that don't, all you
   have to do is to append a single-space character followed by a |space| reference to one
   of the lines in the block.  (And, of course, if you use this capability, you will also
   need to ".. include:: definitions.txt" somewhere early in the file where you do this.)
   The extra space characters won't appear visibly in the output, but the processing will
   cause the surrounding box to disappear.
