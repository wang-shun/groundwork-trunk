Whenever we need to rename objects to renumber them in a sensible sequence,
the following files need to be modified:

CommitTests.pm
commit-pre-test-gwcollagedb.sql
commit-pre-test-monarch-setup-for-gwcollagedb.sql
commit-pre-test-monarch.sql
(Confluent page:  Monarch Commit Operation)

With respect to the last, use the xclip program to copy the Wiki content to
a file, then modify the file, then use xclip to pick up the content of that
file so you can paste it back into the Confluent editor.
