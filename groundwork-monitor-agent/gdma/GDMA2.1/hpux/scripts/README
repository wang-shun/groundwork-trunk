The GDMA-on-HPUX support scripts in this directory get installed in the
locations listed.

ctlscript.sh		/opt/groundwork/ctlscript.sh

gdma.dot.profile	/usr/local/groundwork/users/gdma/.profile

gdma			/sbin/init.d/gdma

			Note:  we also need some symlinks to this file
			from neighboring /sbin/rc#.d/ directories, to get
			the GDMA start and kill actions actually initiated.
			Specifically, we need these two symlinks:

			/sbin/rc2.d/S999gdma -> /sbin/init.d/gdma
			/sbin/rc1.d/K000gdma -> /sbin/init.d/gdma

Also note:

The /opt/groundwork/scripts/setenv.sh file installed on HP-UX must itself
refer to /opt/groundwork/... paths, not to /usr/local/groundwork/... paths.
