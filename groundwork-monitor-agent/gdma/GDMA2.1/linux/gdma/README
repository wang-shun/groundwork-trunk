################################################################################

Here are the steps necessary to build the GDMA 2.1 package.
The supported operating systems are -
rhel5, sles9, sles10, sles11

1. Check out the GDMA 2.1 source code to the RPM build directory -
   http://geneva/groundwork-professional/trunk/monitor-agent/gdma/GDMA2.1/linux/gdma
   On Redhat, the RPM build directory is "/usr/src/redhat/BUILD/"

2. Change the directory to gdma (the checked out directory). Build the RPM -
   $ rpmbuild --bb gdma-2.1.spec
   
3. This will create GDMA 2.1 rpm file in the RPM directory. THis directory is "/usr/src/redhat/RPMS" on Redhat.
   Copy the rpm to the GDMA host.
   
4. As user root, install the RPM on GDMA host
   rpm -iv gdma-2.1-1.i386.rpm
   This will install GDMA under /usr/local/groundwork/gdma. A user "gdma" and a group of same name will be created.
   The GDMA poller and spool processor processes will be launched as system services.
   The owner and group of the processes will be "gdma".
