# This file gives the steps necessary to build the GDMA 2.1 package on supported
# solaris platform and install it on GDMA host
#
################################################################################

The supported operating systems are -
solaris 9, solaris 10.

1. Checkout the GDMA 2.1 source code to any build directory -
   http://geneva/groundwork-professional/trunk/monitor-agent/gdma/GDMA2.1/solaris/

2. The top most directory contains a makefile which does everything that's
   necessary to build a package.
   Type in "make" command to get help. To build GDMA 2.1 package for the platform
   you are building on, type "make gdma_package".
   
3. The usual "make clean" and "make distclean" targets are also available.

4. Don't build as "root". It could be dangerous for your system.

5. Copy over the package to GDMA host and install the package.
   pkgadd -d <package_file_name>
   This will install GDMA under /opt/groundwork/gdma.
   The GDMA poller and spool processor processes will be launched as system services.
   The owner and group of the processes will be "gdma".
