WARNING
================

The files in this directory are restricted to those that we have decided
should augment or replace those that come in the standard Nagios plugins
distribution.

PLEASE DO NOT DROP OTHER ARBITRARY SCRIPTS HERE THAT SIMPLY DUPLICATE
WHAT IS ALREADY AVAILABLE IN THE STANDARD DISTRIBUTION.

The provenance of most of the files in this directory is quite unclear.
Possibly, most of them come from the standard GroundWork base product
at some point in its evolution, though the origin beyond that point is
still unclear, as most of them do not have any correlate in the current
standard Nagios plugins distribution.

Some of these scripts may have been written or enhanced by GroundWork.
Still, we'd like to trace back to the points of origin so we can tell
when updates at those points should be reflected downstream here.
