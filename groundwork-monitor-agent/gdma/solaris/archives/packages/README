The following archived packages reside here:

GWOSgdma-2.0.6-solaris10-sparc.pkg.gz
    A generic package for this GDMA release and OS version; could be used
    for any customer.  This copy defaults the gdma user/group UID/GID
    values to whatever is available on each individual installed client.
    Fixing that will require some Solaris build-scripting changes and
    rolling the GDMA version number on this platform.

GWOSgdmakey-pilmdpgws01-2.0.6-solaris10-sparc.pkg.gz
    A copy of the gdma key package for use by Arbitron in their evaluation
    of GW Monitor; does not contain a known_hosts file.  Allowing the
    inclusion of a known_hosts file in the Solaris package will require
    some Solaris build-scripting changes and rolling the GDMA version
    number on this platform.
