# GWOSgdma preinstall script

# FIX LATER:
# In the future, perhaps implement a request script that will ask the
# adminstrator what UID and GID values to use for the created account,
# if it does not already exist.  Also note the difference between what
# is available in a client machine's environment and what is available
# on the machine from which this patch is being applied, which could
# be a server which manages a diskless client's files.
