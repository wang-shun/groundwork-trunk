# Each "cloud" is known by its region name, per Amazon EC2 standards.
# Eucalyptus has no notion of regions, but it does have the notion of
# a Cloud Controller (CLC), which effectively serves the same purpose.
# However, a ec2-describe-regions listing won't show the values we
# need to use here for a Eucalyptus cloud.  For that type of cloud,
# just use the hostname on which the CLC is running as the region name.
