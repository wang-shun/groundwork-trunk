Sep 20, 2010:  Amazon EC2 Introduces Tagging, Filtering,
Import Key Pair, and Idempotency
================================================================

We are excited to let you know about four separate features that will
make EC2 easier to use for customers with large deployments. First, weve
added the ability to tag EC2 resources to simplify the administration of
your cloud infrastructure. A form of metadata, tags can be used to create
user-friendly names, enhance searchability, and improve coordination
between multiple users. The AWS Management Console has also been updated
to support tagging.

Were also announcing the ability to filter among your EC2 resources
to find ones that match specified criteria. For example, you can use
filtering to quickly determine which instances are running in a particular
Availability Zone or which snapshots are associated with a particular
EBS volume. Filtering will make it easier to manage resources within
your deployment.

Starting today, you can also use your own RSA keys to access your EC2
instances instead of relying on AWS generated keys. This feature gives you
complete control over your private keys and will also allow you to use the
same RSA key across different regions, simplifying resource management.

Last but not the least, you will also be able to idempotently launch
instances so that timeouts or connection errors do not result in the
launch of more instances than you originally intended, saving you time
and money.

================================================================
GroundWork response:
================================================================

We should be using tags as critical metadata for provisioning our
monitoring.  Stay tuned for a design that will cover the use cases we can
envision, and corresponding notes on an implementation that will address
anticipated customer deployment issues.

Also, we want a mechanism for pulling Amazon CloudWatch metrics out of EC2
and folding them into GroundWork.

Also, we might think about plugins for stuff like Hadoop, Cassandra,
and Mongo.

Monitoring System For The Cloud?

I need a monitoring system, much like ganglia / nagios that is
build for the cloud. I need it to support : Adding / removing nodes
dynamically. (Node shuts down, dose not imply node failure...) Dynamic
node based categorization, meaning node can identify them self as being
part of group X (ganglia gets this almost right, but lacks the dynamic
part...) Does not require multicast support (generally not allowed
in cloud based setups) Plugins for recent cool stuff such as Hadoop,
Cassandra, Mongo would be cool. More features include: External API,
web interface and co. I've looked at Ganglia, munin and they both seem
be almost there (but not exactly). I would also go for reasonably priced
Software as Service solution. I'm currently doing research, so Suggestions
are highly appreciated.
