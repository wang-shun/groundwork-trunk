The Eucalyptus page here:

    http://open.eucalyptus.com/wiki/ToolsEcosystem

says as of this writing (Sat Apr 10 19:57:57 PDT 2010) that:

    http://s3.amazonaws.com/ec2-downloads/ec2-api-tools-1.3-30349.zip

is the latest EC2 API tools version supported for talking to Eucalyptus
clouds.  We have been using ec2-api-tools-1.3-46266.zip in our testing
so far for Cloud Connector 1.0.0, so we might need to back down to a
version which is documented to be compatible with Eucalyptus, at least
when accessing Eucalyptus clouds.  Possibly we might want to use different
tools for different clouds, allowing ourselves to use the most up-to-date
EC2 tools when accessing an actual EC2 cloud.  Note the dates on which
these versions were made available by Amazon:

    7644924 Dec  9, 2008 ec2-api-tools-1.3-30349.zip
    8328324 Dec 13, 2009 ec2-api-tools-1.3-46266.zip
    8426964 Sep 16, 2010 ec2-api-tools-1.3-57419.zip

so we'd really rather not be using the older tools with EC2.
