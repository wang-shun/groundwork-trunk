# Some funkiness is used here to make this invocation support multiple shells.
# It must be sourced, not executed:
#
#    In tcsh:  source setenv-cloud {region}
#    In bash:  . setenv-cloud {region}
#    In  ksh:  . setenv-cloud {region}
#
# This script is carefully constructed so it will execute under any of the
# tcsh, bash, or ksh shells.  The "$status" shell variable is used as a marker
# that we're executing under tcsh (so far, we haven't thought of anything else
# that can be safely tested under other shells).  We carefully avoid using
# conditional-logic syntax that is specific to a particular shell, preferring
# instead to use portable single-line conditional commands.

# This section supports tcsh, and will be effectively ignored by other shells.
# The "exit" here, if taken, will simply exit the "source" command, and leave the
# original shell still standing.

# This section supports bash and related shells, and will be effectively ignored by
# tcsh (except that it parses all of each line even though it won't execute all of it).
# The "return" here, if taken, will simply exit the "." command, and leave the
# original shell still standing.
