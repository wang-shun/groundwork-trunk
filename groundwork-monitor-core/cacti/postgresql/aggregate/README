The Cacti "aggregate" 0.75 plugin has now been ported by GroundWork to
support the PostgreSQL database in addition to its prior support for
the MySQL database.  It is now a built-in part of GroundWork Monitor,
starting with the 7.1.1 release.

================================================================

Documentation
-------------

The installation of the Cacti "aggregate" plugin also includes a full
manual, located here within the GroundWork Cacti distribution:

    /usr/local/groundwork/cacti/htdocs/plugins/aggregate/aggregate_manual.pdf

The manual can also be viewed directly on-line here:

    http://docs.cacti.net/_media/plugin:aggregate_manual_v075.pdf

The files in this directory are currently:

README
    The file you are now reading.

aggregate-0.75-patch-for-postgres9.tar.gz
    The patches to port the 0.75 version of the "aggregate" plugin code
    to also work with a PostgreSQL-based Cacti distribution, as created
    by the make_aggregate_plugin_porting_patches script.  Our build
    process uses this file.

aggregate_tables_for_migration_to_postgresql.sql.tar.gz
    This file is to be used in migrating data from a MySQL-based Cacti
    to a PostgreSQL-based Cacti.  It creates the two tables needed by
    the "aggregate" plugin, but does not populate them.  The tables are
    then ready to receive data during the migration process.  See the
    instructions below.

cacti_htdocs_lib_plugins.php.tar.gz
    A replacement file for /usr/local/groundwork/cacti/htdocs/lib/plugins.php
    that fixes a bug in our porting of Cacti 0.8.7g to PostgreSQL, for use
    with GroundWork Monitor releases before 7.1.1.  Created by running the
    following command against a system with the replacement file installed:

	tar cvfz cacti_htdocs_lib_plugins.php.tar.gz \
	    -C /usr/local/groundwork cacti/htdocs/lib/plugins.php
    
    See the description of the cacti_htdocs_plugins_aggregate-0.75.tar.gz
    file below.

cacti_htdocs_plugins_aggregate-0.75.tar.gz
    The Cacti "aggregate" plugin code, version 0.75, including the
    GroundWork changes to allow use with PostgreSQL.  Created by
    running the following command against a system with the ported
    plugin installed:

	tar cvfz cacti_htdocs_plugins_aggregate-0.75.tar.gz \
	    -C /usr/local/groundwork cacti/htdocs/plugins/aggregate

    This tarball can be used with any PostgreSQL-based GroundWork release
    before 7.1.1.  In those GroundWork releases, it is necessary to
    also apply the cacti_htdocs_lib_plugins.php.tar.gz file (above)
    to that release, following the instructions below, to fix a bug in
    our prior porting of Cacti to PostgreSQL.

dump_cacti_aggregate_plugin_tables
    Script to generate aggregate_tables_for_migration_to_postgresql.sql.tar.gz
    from a PostgreSQL-based system with the Cacti "aggregate" plugin available
    and installed.

make_aggregate_plugin_porting_patches
    A script to generate the aggregate-0.75-patch-for-postgres9.tar.gz
    tarball from the original plugin files and our ported files.

plugin:aggregate-v0.75.tgz
    The official Cacti "aggregate" plugin code, version 0.75.  This version
    works only with a MySQL-based Cacti installation.  Our build process
    uses this file.

================================================================

Upgrading a MySQL-based GroundWork release using the "aggregate" plugin
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

If a customer was using the "aggregate" plugin in a MySQL-based Cacti
and now wants to migrate to the PostgreSQL-based Cacti in our recent
GroundWork Monitor releases, some extra steps are needed to make sure
that empty versions of the two "cacti"-database tables used by the
"aggregate" plugin are available on the PostgreSQL side to receive
data during the migration process.  The following extra steps must be
run at the very beginning of the "MySQL to PostgreSQL Data Migration"
section in the "Installing or Upgrading to GroundWork Monitor X.X.X"
document you are using.

Before running the "master_migration_to_pg.pl" script in this section,
download the aggregate_tables_for_migration_to_postgresql.sql.tar.gz
file from GroundWork and place it into the /tmp directory.  Then run
these commands to add the necessary tables to the "cacti" database:

    cd /tmp
    tar xvfz aggregate_tables_for_migration_to_postgresql.sql.tar.gz

    /usr/local/groundwork/postgresql/bin/psql -U postgres -d cacti \
	-f /tmp/aggregate_tables_for_migration_to_postgresql.sql

You might need to take similar steps at this point to also create
empty Cacti tables for other plugins (e.g., "nectar" and "realtime")
that GroundWork has historically not bundled with Cacti.

You may then proceed with the rest of the "MySQL to PostgreSQL Data
Migration" section, as documented.

================================================================

Installing the "aggregate" plugin on older GroundWork releases
--------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE:  If you were upgrading from a MySQL-based release, first take the
steps in the previous section during the migration process.  Once the
GroundWork system is fully up and running, come back here and take these
steps to complete the process.

To install the "aggregate" plugin on a PostgreSQL-based GroundWork release
before 7.1.1, download these two files from GroundWork and place them
into the /tmp directory:

    cacti_htdocs_lib_plugins.php.tar.gz
    cacti_htdocs_plugins_aggregate-0.75.tar.gz

Then run the following commands:

    su nagios
    cd /usr/local/groundwork
    cp -p cacti/htdocs/lib/plugins.php cacti/htdocs/lib/plugins.php.orig
    tar xvfz /tmp/cacti_htdocs_lib_plugins.php.tar.gz
    tar xvfz /tmp/cacti_htdocs_plugins_aggregate-0.75.tar.gz
    exit

The "Aggregate" plugin should now appear in the "Plugin Management"
section of the Cacti screens.
