This document contains notes on the Cacti "nectar" plugin in the context
of a GroundWork Monitor server installation.

================================================================
Installation of the Cacti "nectar" plugin
================================================================

In GroundWork Monitor, to fully enable the Cacti "nectar" plugin, you
must take certain actions beyond just installing and enabling the plugin
in Cacti's Console > Plugin Management screen.

Per the "nectar" plugin README file:

    NOTE: You must patch the settings plugin using the attached patch

    NOTE: Using Cacti 0.8.7g with PIA 2.8 requires to replace 
	  plugins/settings/include/mailer.php with the one found in
	  nectar/0.8.7g

Here are the commands to take those actions.  This procedure will leave
clearly labeled backup copies of the files involved, to make it easy to
reverse these changes if necessary.

    su nagios
    cd /usr/local/groundwork/cacti/htdocs/plugins/settings/include

    cp -p functions.php functions.php.settings-0.5
    patch -b -V simple -z .pre_nectar-0.35a -p4 < ../../nectar/0.8.7e/settings_include_functions.php.patch

    mv mailer.php mailer.php.settings-0.5
    cp -p ../../nectar/0.8.7g/mailer.php mailer.php.nectar-0.35a
    cp -p mailer.php.nectar-0.35a mailer.php

    exit

Beyond that, PHP must be instructed to read the email message that the
"nectar" plugin produces to find the recipient information, instead of
depending on a command-line argument for that address.  Normally, this
is done with the "sendmail -t" option, and that is part of the default
setting for PHP.  However, the default path to the sendmail program
might not be correct for your system.  To check that, use:

    % /usr/local/groundwork/php/bin/php -i | fgrep sendmail_path
    sendmail_path => /usr/bin/sendmail -t -i  => /usr/bin/sendmail -t -i 

That looks good, except for one important detail.  On at least Red Hat
Enterprise Linux, CentOS, and Ubuntu, the sendmail program is actually
installed as /usr/sbin/sendmail instead of /usr/bin/sendmail, so if you
see the /usr/bin directory listed, the configured default path just
won't work.  If your system has a similar mismatch, you will need to
edit the /usr/local/groundwork/php/etc/php.ini file to specify a path
that works.  For instance, change:

    ; For Unix only.  You may supply arguments as well (default: "sendmail -t -i").
    ;sendmail_path =

to:

    ; For Unix only.  You may supply arguments as well (default: "sendmail -t -i").
    sendmail_path = "/usr/sbin/sendmail -t -i"

You should now see the correct path for your system:

    % /usr/local/groundwork/php/bin/php -i | fgrep sendmail_path
    sendmail_path => /usr/sbin/sendmail -t -i => /usr/sbin/sendmail -t -i
