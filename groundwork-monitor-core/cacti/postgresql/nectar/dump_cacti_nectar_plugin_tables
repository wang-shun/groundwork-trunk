# dump_cacti_nectar_plugin_tables
#
# Script to dump out the new table objects used by the Cacti "nectar" plugin,
# to create the nectar_tables_for_migration_to_postgresql.sql.tar.gz file.  See
# the README in this directory for more information about this tarball and how it
# is to be used to migrate from a MySQL-based Cacti release to a PostgreSQL-based
# Cacti release.
