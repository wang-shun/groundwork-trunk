predict_0.1.3_postgresql_and_fixes.tar.gz
    A version of the Cacti "predict" 0.1.3 plugin, ported by GroundWork to
    work under PostgreSQL and also having a number of other bugs fixed.

userplugin:predict_0.1.3.zip
    The original Cacti "predict" plugin code, version 0.1.3.  This version
    works only with a MySQL-based Cacti installation.

userplugin:predict_1.0.0.zip
    The official Cacti "predict" plugin code, version 1.0.0.  This version
    includes the GroundWork changes to allow use with PostgreSQL, with
    only one further change for our builds (change the permissions on
    the predict/tmp/ directory to 755 instead of 777).

For early GWMEE 7.0.0 builds, predict_0.1.3_postgresql_and_fixes.tar.gz
was used as-is to drop the ported plugin into our builds.  We didn't
bother trying to create equivalent patches and then applying them at
build time.  This tarball does include .orig and .pre_pg backup files
of the original code, in case you wanted to examine the differences and
create such patches for application to some future release of this plugin.
However, we sent this tarball to the upstream maintainer so he could
adopt the changes wholesale, and he did so to create the 1.0.0 release.
So there is no need to apply such patches to a future release of this
plugin.
