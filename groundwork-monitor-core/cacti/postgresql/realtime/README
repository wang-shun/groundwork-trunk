The Cacti "realtime" 0.5-2 plugin has now been ported by GroundWork to
support the PostgreSQL database in addition to its prior support for
the MySQL database.  It is now a built-in part of GroundWork Monitor,
starting with the 7.1.1 release.

================================================================

Documentation
-------------

Useful documentation on the "realtime" plugin is somewhat sparse.
You should start with the advice on the plugin's official page, here:

    http://docs.cacti.net/plugin:realtime

Here is practical advice for setting up and using this plugin under
GroundWork Monitor:

(1) Go to the Cacti plugins page:  Advanced > Network Graphing > Plugin
    Management.

(2) Install and Enable the "Realtime" plugin by clicking on the blue-arrow
    button for that plugin, then the green-arrow button for that plugin.

(3) While logged in to a terminal window as the "nagios" user, make a
    directory for the "realtime" plugin to use to store its RRD files
    (its "Cache Directory").  For general security, make sure the
    directory is created with appropriately restricted permissions.

	# Here is a suggested location for the
	# Cacti "realtime" plugin Cache Directory.
	su nagios
	umask 22
	mkdir /usr/local/groundwork/cacti/htdocs/plugins/realtime/rrd
	exit

(4) Go to Settings > Misc.  In the "Realtime Graphs" section, choose
    the setup options you desire.  Use Ajax if you can; it operates
    smoother than not using it.  Set the Cache Directory to the absolute
    pathname of the directory you just created.  Scroll down to the bottom
    of the screen, and click the Save button.  Scroll back up and look
    at the notation under the Cache Directory setting, to ensure that
    the path you have chosen is acceptable to the "realtime" plugin.

(5) Go to User Management > {user name} > Realm Permissions, and verify
    that you have given access to "Plugin -> Realtime" to the user who
    will be operating this plugin.  If you make a change, Save it.

(6) Now go to the "graphs" tab at the top of the Cacti screen.  For each
    graph, you should now see a small squiggley-line icon to the right
    of each graph image.  If you hover your mouse pointer over that icon,
    you will see a "Realtime" tooltip show up.  Just click on that icon to
    see a pop-up window containing the real-time version of that graph.
    If this is the first time you have viewed the real-time version of
    a particular graph, it may take a cycle or two of the configured
    Interval for data to start showing up in the displayed graph.

(7) You can experiment with the other plugin-level Settings and the
    controls for an individual graph in its pop-up window.  We won't
    describe those further here.

(8) That's the extent of this plugin.

The files in this directory are currently:

README
    The file you are now reading.

cacti_htdocs_plugins_realtime-0.5-2.tar.gz
    The Cacti "realtime" plugin code, version 0.5-2, including the
    GroundWork changes to allow use with PostgreSQL and other fixes.
    Created by running the following command against a system with the
    ported plugin installed:

	tar cvfz cacti_htdocs_plugins_realtime-0.5-2.tar.gz \
	    -C /usr/local/groundwork cacti/htdocs/plugins/realtime

    This tarball can be used with any PostgreSQL-based GroundWork release
    before 7.1.1.

dump_cacti_realtime_plugin_table
    Script to generate realtime_table_for_migration_to_postgresql.sql.tar.gz
    from a PostgreSQL-based system with the Cacti "realtime" plugin available
    and installed.

make_realtime_plugin_porting_patches
    A script to generate the realtime-0.5-2-patch-for-postgres9.tar.gz
    tarball from the original plugin files and our ported files.

plugin:realtime-v0.5-2.tgz
    The official Cacti "realtime" plugin code, version 0.5-2.  This version
    works only with a MySQL-based Cacti installation.  Our build process
    uses this file.

realtime-0.5-2-patch-for-postgres9.tar.gz
    The patches to port the 0.5-2 version of the "realtime" plugin code to
    also work with a PostgreSQL-based Cacti distribution, as created by
    the make_realtime_plugin_porting_patches script.  These patches also
    include some cleanup not directly related to porting to PostgreSQL,
    to make the plugin work within the GroundWork Monitor context and
    so the pop-up windows operate more smoothly.  Our build process uses
    this file.

realtime_table_for_migration_to_postgresql.sql.tar.gz
    This file is to be used in migrating data from a MySQL-based Cacti
    to a PostgreSQL-based Cacti.  It creates the one table needed by
    the "realtime" plugin, but does not populate it.  The table is
    then ready to receive data during the migration process.  See the
    instructions below.

================================================================

Upgrading a MySQL-based GroundWork release using the "realtime" plugin
----------------------------------------------------------------------

If a customer was using the "realtime" plugin in a MySQL-based Cacti
and now wants to migrate to the PostgreSQL-based Cacti in our recent
GroundWork Monitor releases, some extra steps are needed to make sure
that an empty version of the one "cacti"-database table used by the
"realtime" plugin is available on the PostgreSQL side to receive data
during the migration process.  The following extra steps must be run at
the very beginning of the "MySQL to PostgreSQL Data Migration" section
in the "Installing or Upgrading to GroundWork Monitor X.X.X" document
you are using.

Before running the "master_migration_to_pg.pl" script in this section,
download the realtime_table_for_migration_to_postgresql.sql.tar.gz
file from GroundWork and place it into the /tmp directory.  Then run
these commands to add the necessary table to the "cacti" database:

    cd /tmp
    tar xvfz realtime_table_for_migration_to_postgresql.sql.tar.gz

    /usr/local/groundwork/postgresql/bin/psql -U postgres -d cacti \
	-f /tmp/realtime_table_for_migration_to_postgresql.sql

You might need to take similar steps at this point to also create
empty Cacti tables for other plugins (e.g., "aggregate" and "nectar")
that GroundWork has historically not bundled with Cacti.

You may then proceed with the rest of the "MySQL to PostgreSQL Data
Migration" section, as documented.

================================================================

Installing the "realtime" plugin on older GroundWork releases
-------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE:  If you were upgrading from a MySQL-based release, first take the
steps in the previous section during the migration process.  Once the
GroundWork system is fully up and running, come back here and take these
steps to complete the process.

To install the "realtime" plugin on a PostgreSQL-based GroundWork release
before 7.1.1, download this one file from GroundWork and place it into
the /tmp directory:

    cacti_htdocs_plugins_realtime-0.5-2.tar.gz

Then run the following commands:

    su nagios
    cd /usr/local/groundwork
    tar xvfz /tmp/cacti_htdocs_plugins_realtime-0.5-2.tar.gz
    exit

The "Realtime" plugin should now appear in the "Plugin Management"
section of the Cacti screens.
