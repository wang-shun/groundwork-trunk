Note:  The patch found here in usr_lib_rpm_perl.req.patch is necessary
to patch the installed rpm-build-4.4.2.3-18.el5 package, which is the
latest version available under CentOS5 as of this writing (according
to yum).  That package does not properly analyze the Perl dependency
requirements found in one of the Perl packages we include in the Disaster
Recovery build.  This issue has now been reported to the RPM developers
(http://www.rpm.org/ticket/128), but the fix probably won't show up in
standard Linux distributions for some time.  Hence the need to patch
the copy you are running with on your own build machine.
