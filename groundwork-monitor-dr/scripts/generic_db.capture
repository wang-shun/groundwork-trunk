# FIX THIS
# Stop any applications program that might alter the content of the database.  That includes
# any daemons, any cron jobs, and any other periodically-run programs.  Each must either be
# brought down completely, or at least have its contents flushed and be prevented from making
# further alterations for the time being, or be blocked from starting.  If it is a program
# that is run periodically that might now be in progress, it must either be stopped or we
# must wait for its current cycle to complete (with some timeout before killing it anyway).

# FIX THIS
# Start or unblock the application programs stopped or blocked above.  Reverse the actions we
# took above to stop the application, so that daemons will begin anew or pick up again from
# where they were paused, cron jobs get unblocked, and any other related programs may run again.
