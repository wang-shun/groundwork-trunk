# Check-Ganglia log
#
# The standard-output stream from the check_ganglia.pl daemon is captured by
# a freedt (supervise) dumblog process invoked by the base GroundWork Monitor
# product, and written to the log file listed here.  Sending that dumblog
# process a HUP signal is sufficient to have it killed, and when it is
# automatically restarted by its parent "supervise" process, the new copy
# will open a new output file, once again capturing the standard-output stream
# of our daemon, which remains running the entire time.

# Auto-Import log
#
# /usr/local/groundwork/nagios/var/log/autoimport.log is the default value for
# the logfile option configured in /usr/local/groundwork/config/autoimport.conf
# to affect the /usr/local/groundwork/nagios/libexec/autoimport.pl script.  That
# script can be run at the will of the administrator.  The script opens the file
# in append mode on each run, and closes it at the end of that run.  Thus there
# is no need to send the script a signal that the file has been rotated, as the
# next run will simply open and use a new file with the original filename.
