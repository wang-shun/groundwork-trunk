=================================
Notes on particular Perl packages
=================================

(*) The VMS::Stdio package is referenced from File::Temp (which is part
    of ExtUtils::MakeMaker), but it is only require'd (on a VMS platform),
    not use'd.  Since we aren't running this code under VMS, we don't have
    the necessary header files to compile this package and include it in
    our distribution.  So we simply suppress the RPM requirement for this
    package, in our specfile.

(*) Similarly, the VMS::Filespec package is also referenced from within
    the ExtUtils::MakeMaker package, but only in VMS contexts, so there
    is no danger that we will need to include this package in our builds.
    (Compiling it demands the presence of VMS header files, so we can't
    build it anyway.)  So as with VMS::Stdio, we simply suppress the RPM
    requirement for this package, in our specfile.
