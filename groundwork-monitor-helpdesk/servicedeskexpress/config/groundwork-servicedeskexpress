# logrotate configuration for GroundWork Service Desk Express integration files

# Service Desk Express integration log output
#
# /usr/local/groundwork/servicedeskexpress/logs/oneway.log
# /usr/local/groundwork/servicedeskexpress/logs/twoway.log
# are configured in:
# /usr/local/groundwork/servicedeskexpress/config/oneway_helpdesk.conf
# /usr/local/groundwork/servicedeskexpress/config/twoway_helpdesk.conf
# respectively.  Both the oneway_helpdesk.pl and twoway_helpdesk.pl scripts
# open and close their logfile in append mode around every message written
# to their respective logfile, so there is no issue with synchronizing log
# rotation actions here with the operations of the scripts.
