This "customer" directory contains various files that may be relevant
to installing or documenting the installation at a given customer site.
Use of these files, for instance in configuring the BMC Service Desk
Express Integration Engine by importing the web service package files,
is outside the scope of this README file.

The following files are presently stored here:

HRA-GroundWorkInsertUpdate.xml
    The definition of a BMC Service Desk Express Integration Engine web
    services based package, named GroundWorkInsertUpdate, for use at HRA.
    This definition includes certain URL information (at least) that
    is specific to the HRA customer, so it would need to be modified
    (and renamed) for use at other customer sites.

HRA-GroundWorkSelect.xml
    The definition of a BMC Service Desk Express Integration Engine web
    services based package, named GroundWorkSelect, for use at HRA.
    This definition includes certain URL information (at least) that
    is specific to the HRA customer, so it would need to be modified
    (and renamed) for use at other customer sites.

HRA_Site_Codes.xls
    A spreadsheet documenting the original list of 96 HRA locations
    that have hostgroups defined within GroundWork Monitor for use in
