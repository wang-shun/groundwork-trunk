In the 2.0.0 release, the ActionProperty row added to the database
has had a path changed from what it was in the original MySQL version;
this will need to be dealt with in any migration from the older release.
The paths are:

old:  /usr/local/groundwork/helpdesk/bin/oneway_helpdesk.pl
new:  /usr/local/groundwork/servicedeskexpress/bin/oneway_helpdesk.pl

in the code, effectively (not exactly as shown here)

old: helpdesk_actions_seed_file.sql:
     INSERT INTO ActionProperty (ActionID, Name, Value) VALUES(
	  (SELECT ActionID FROM Action WHERE Name = "Create a HelpDesk Ticket"),
	  "Script", "/usr/local/groundwork/helpdesk/bin/oneway_helpdesk.pl");

new: helpdesk_actions_seed_file.sql:
     INSERT INTO ActionProperty (ActionID, Name, Value) VALUES(
          (SELECT ActionID FROM Action WHERE Name = ActionMenuString),
	  'Script', '/usr/local/groundwork/servicedeskexpress/bin/oneway_helpdesk.pl');

FIX LATER:  Provide a migration script to make this change, containing
the SQL statement just below.  Similarly, some pathnames have changed
in several config files.  Again, we should have a migration script to
make these changes, if there is any concern about using the old copies
instead of the new copies that already have good pathnames in them,
and to move files around.
