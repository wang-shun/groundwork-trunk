The 2.0.0 release of the GroundWork integration with BMC Service
Desk Express is based on the PostgreSQL database.  This release of the
integration package is for use with GroundWork Monitor 6.7.0.  The design
is based on an integration with BMC Service Desk Express version 9.8,
and is not guaranteed or assumed to work with newer versions of the
BMC software.
