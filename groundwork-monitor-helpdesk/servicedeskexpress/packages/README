Notes on particular Perl packages
=================================

(*) The SOAP::Lite distribution was poorly refactored in its 0.715 release,
    with the result that SOAP::Transport::TCP was extracted into a separate
    package.  But while that package still references the IO::SessionData and
    IO::SessionSet packages, they are nowhere to be found on CPAN (they used to
    be bundled in with the SOAP::Lite distribution, before this refactoring).
    To resolve this, I have taken the IO-SessionData-0.001.tar.gz file from
    this URL instead of from CPAN, where it doesn't exist:

	https://github.com/RsrchBoy/io-sessiondata/tree/tarballs

    which is referenced from this bug report on the SOAP::Transport::TCP
    package:

	https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=78495

    Comparing this package from an odd source to the same files from
    the SOAP::Lite 0.714 distribution, this looks safe to use, so we are
    proceeding on that basis.

(*) The VMS::Stdio package is referenced from File::Temp (which is part
    of ExtUtils::MakeMaker), but it is only require'd (on a VMS platform),
    not use'd.  Since we aren't running this code under VMS, we don't have
    the necessary header files to compile this package and include it in
    our distribution.  So we simply suppress the RPM requirement for this
    package, in our specfile.

(*) Similarly, the VMS::Filespec package is also referenced from within
    the ExtUtils::MakeMaker package, but only in VMS contexts, so there
    is no danger that we will need to include this package in our builds.
    (Compiling it demands the presence of VMS header files, so we can't
    build it anyway.)  So as with VMS::Stdio, we simply suppress the RPM
    requirement for this package, in our specfile.
