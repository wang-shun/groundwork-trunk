Note:  The patch found here in usr_lib_rpm_perl.req.patch is necessary
to patch the installed rpm-build-4.4.2.3-32.el5_9 package, which is the
latest version available under CentOS 5.9 as of this writing (according
to yum).  That package does not properly analyze the Perl dependency
requirements found in one of the Perl packages we include in the Disaster
Recovery build, and in the servicedeskexpress build.  This issue has now
been reported to the RPM developers (http://www.rpm.org/ticket/128),
and it appears to be folded into the current upstream release of RPM
(4.11.0.1), but the fix hasn't shown up in CentOS 5.9.  CentOS 6.3
includes 4.8.0-32.el6, which does include this patch.  I don't know the
status in other Linux distributions.  Hence the possible need to patch
the copy you are running with on your own build machine.

The patch here is a slightly updated version of the one we originally
generated while building the monitor-dr (Disaster Recovery) project.

Note that our patching of /usr/lib/rpm/perl.req is subject to being
"repaired" when the rpm-build package is updated by yum, so this patch
may need to be re-applied to the system at some future time.
