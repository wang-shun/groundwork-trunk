Here's how to get a dump of the WSDL for a ServiceNow Incident for a
given customer system:

    wget --user='{username}' --password='{password}' 'https://commonwealthdev.service-now.com/incident.do?WSDL' -O incident_wsdl.xml
    xmllint --format incident_wsdl.xml > incident_wsdl

where the username and password are as specified by the customer, and the
URL is as specified by the customer for Incident creation, but with the
"?WSDL" query extension appended.

The reason you want such a dump is that it provides the exact ServiceNow
incident field names under which particular values must be submitted to
either create a new ServiceNow incident, or to probe particular incident
details at a later time.  This is an invaluable tool during development.
