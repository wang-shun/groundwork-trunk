More stuff that should be done with the ServiceNow integration:

(*) When GroundWork packages extra add-on Perl modules as we
    do for this integration, they should ultimately end up under
    /usr/local/groundwork/perl/lib/site_perl/5.8.9/ since that would
    be the proper place for a local add-on.  But this also means that
    all the packages we currently supply in the GWMEE base release
    under that directory ought instead to be placed by Bitrock in
    the /usr/local/groundwork/perl/lib/vendor_perl/5.8.9/ directory,
    which is the proper place for stuff that we as a Perl distribution
    vendor ought to be using for code that is beyond the base Perl
    release content.  The current use of .../site_perl/... for this
    purpose really represents a misunderstanding of how the Perl library
    hierarchy is intended to be constructed.

    The only problem with using
    /usr/local/groundwork/perl/lib/site_perl/5.8.9/ as the proper place
    for add-on packages is that we might have conflicts between our own
    add-on packages which were supplied at different times, that could
    include different versions of particular Perl (e.g., CPAN) packages.
    We would need to maintain a separate GroundWork-Perl add-on package
    that represents the full set of latest-update packages that can
    serve for all of our add-ons.  By shipping that extra Perl package,
    we could avoid bundling Perl modules in each separate GroundWork
    add-on extension.

(*) When I build the Perl modules locally before stuffing them into the
    RPM build file hierarchy, certain files end up with embedded pathnames
    that represent my build environment instead of the ultimate target
    environment.  Currently, the set of files affected is:

    ./perl/lib/x86_64-linux-thread-multi/perllocal.pod
    ./perl/lib/x86_64-linux-thread-multi/auto/Email/Date/Format/.packlist
    ./perl/lib/x86_64-linux-thread-multi/auto/MIME/Lite/.packlist
    ./perl/lib/x86_64-linux-thread-multi/auto/MIME/Types/.packlist
    ./perl/lib/x86_64-linux-thread-multi/auto/Class/Inspector/.packlist
    ./perl/lib/x86_64-linux-thread-multi/auto/Task/Weaken/.packlist
    ./perl/lib/x86_64-linux-thread-multi/auto/SOAP/Lite/.packlist
    ./perl/lib/x86_64-linux-thread-multi/auto/ServiceNow/.packlist
    ./perl/lib/x86_64-linux-thread-multi/auto/ExtUtils/MakeMaker/.packlist

    None of these files is critical to operation of the software, but
    for cleanliness, we ought to programmatically alter the paths these
    files contain to represent actual eventual installed locations.

(*) Refactor the HelpDesk.pm module and supporting scripts and config
    files, so the ticketing framework is better separated from the
    individual customizations for particular ticketing service providers.
    Then package the framework and the customizations separately.

(*) The twoway_helpdesk.pl script currently takes no notice if a
    resolved ticket is subsequently re-opened.  This leaves a hole in
    our monitoring of the ticket status.  We ought to scan for any
    resolved tickets still in the HelpDeskLookupTable, and if they
    have been re-opened, adjust their Operation Status within the
    GroundWork Monitor system.

(*) The code in modules/ServiceNow/HelpDesk.pm needs to be looked at for
    the wrong-current-configuration-database issue noted in GWMON-9076,
    as regards its use of "monarch"-database information.  When we
    resolve that JIRA by renaming the future-configuration database,
    this script will need to adapt accordingly.
