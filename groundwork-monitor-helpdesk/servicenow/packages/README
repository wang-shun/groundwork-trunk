The ServiceNow 1.00 package was downloaded from:

    http://wiki.service-now.com/images/e/e3/Servicenow-1.00.tar.gz

and then renamed to:

    ServiceNow-1.00.tar.gz

to match the name of the directory it contains, to achieve a consistent
naming construction along with all the other Perl packages we use.

----------------------------------------------------------------

The ServiceNow-1.00.patch is needed to fix a small build problem
with the ServiceNow package.  This adjustment was developed by
GroundWork after we tried to build the ServiceNow package.  This
patch has been forwarded to the Service-Now folks, so it might
not be needed for some future release of the ServiceNow package.
But it is still apparently needed for the ServiceNow-1.01 release,
so we still have an equivalent ServiceNow-1.01.patch patch here.

----------------------------------------------------------------

The ServiceNow 1.01 package was downloaded from:

    http://wiki.servicenow.com/images/e/e5/ServiceNow-Perl-API.zip

which is mentioned on this page:

    http://wiki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Perl_API

It was then manually repackaged into the ServiceNow-1.01.tar.gz
tarball, which makes it easier to process here.

----------------------------------------------------------------

All the other packages were downloaded from CPAN.
