Note:  The patch found here in usr_lib_rpm_perl.req.patch is necessary
to patch the installed rpm-build-4.4.2.3-36.el5_11 package, which is the
latest version available under CentOS 5.11 as of this writing (according
to yum).  That package does not properly analyze the Perl dependency
requirements found in one of the Perl packages we include in the Disaster
Recovery build, and in the monitor-helpdesk/servicedeskexpress build,
and in the monitor-helpdesk/servicenow build.  This issue has now been
reported to the RPM developers (http://www.rpm.org/ticket/128), though
that bug-reporting system seems to be inaccessible now in favor of a new
bug-tracking system for this project.  The Wayback machine still has a
copy, though:

My fix appears to be folded into the current upstream release of RPM
(4.11.0.1), but the fix hasn't shown up in CentOS 5.11.  CentOS 6.3
includes 4.8.0-32.el6, which does include this patch.  I don't know the
status in other Linux distributions.  Hence the possible need to patch
the copy you are running with on your own build machine.

CentOS Linux release 7.3.1611 includes RPM version 4.11.3, so that
version should be safe from the effects of this bug.

The patch here is a slightly updated version of the one we originally
generated while building the monitor-dr (Disaster Recovery) project.

Note that our patching of /usr/lib/rpm/perl.req is subject to being
"repaired" whenever the rpm-build package is updated by yum, so this
patch may need to be re-applied to the system at some future time.

The patch may be applied this way, running as root:
# patch -p0 -b -z .backup.`date +%s` < usr_lib_rpm_perl.req.patch
