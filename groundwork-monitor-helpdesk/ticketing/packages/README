Notes on particular Perl packages
================================================================

The ServiceNow 1.01 package was downloaded from:

    http://wiki.servicenow.com/images/e/e5/ServiceNow-Perl-API.zip

which is mentioned on this page:

    http://wiki.servicenow.com/index.php?title=Perl_API

It was then manually repackaged into the ServiceNow-1.01.tar.gz
tarball, which makes it easier to process here.

Note that this versio of the ServiceNow package still internally
declares itself to be version 1.00, not version 1.01.  That does
not cause any disruption except to humans who expect the code to
be clean.

----------------------------------------------------------------

The ServiceNow-1.01.patch is needed to fix a small build problem
with the ServiceNow package.  This adjustment was developed by
GroundWork after we tried to build the ServiceNow package.  This
patch has been forwarded to the Service-Now folks, so it might
not be needed for some future release of the ServiceNow package.

See this URL for updated information on the Perl API:

https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/istanbul-servicenow-platform/page/integrate/perl/concept/c_PerlAPI.html

(not that it's terribly more informative or helpful than previous
iterations of the upstream documentation).

As of Feb 12 2017, ServiceNow 1.01 is still current, and timestamped
upstream as:

    2013-06-08 10:23:23 ServiceNow-Perl-API.zip

All the other packages were downloaded from CPAN.
