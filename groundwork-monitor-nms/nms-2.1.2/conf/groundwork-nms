# Cacti log file

# /usr/local/groundwork/nms/applications/cacti/log/cacti.log
# is set as the standard (defaulted) Cacti log file, if the path_cactilog
# config option in Cacti is not set to something else.  It is written to
# by PHP scripts that appear to just open and close the file around every
# message written to the file, so there is no reason to signal any scripts
# when the logfile is rotated.
