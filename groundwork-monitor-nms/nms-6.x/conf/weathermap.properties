# You should be able to define whatever Weathermap (Cacti) instance labels are
# most convenient for your environment, in the various "weathermap.$label.field"
# parameter groups.  Characters in instance labels are limited to alphanumerics
# and underscore.  Any code that does not support this construction should be
# rewritten to do so.
#
# For the moment, though, you are restricted to simple numeric labels.
