To do:

(*) In Spine, various delete/insert transactions need to be wrapped
    in code that will detect a serialization failure and retry the
    transaction, at least up to some configured number of times.

(*) "make -n" is not propagating the -n option to subsidiary makes.
    In particular, it is running the build in the postgresql_as_mysql
    directory, and it is running the configure (at least) in the
    cacti-spine-0.8.7g directory.  FIx this so MAKEFLAGS is correctly
    propagated and paid attention to at all levels.
