# logrotate configuration for GroundWork Monitor database files

# PostgreSQL log file
#
# The directory and filename for this log file are configured in
# /usr/local/groundwork/postgresql/data/postgresql.conf
# and changes to those settings will only take effect upon restart of
# the PostgreSQL server.  Here, we only handle periodic renaming of an
# existing log file, rolling out to a limited number of old copies.
# This mechanism provides a means of purging sufficiently-old data,
# so we don't have infinite growth of the log file.  The PostgreSQL
# server will itself take care of opening a new log file some time
# relatively soon after we have renamed the existing file, depending on
# the value of the log_rotation_age parameter in the postgresql.conf
# config file.  Typically, we configure that switchover to happen within
# an hour; in the meantime, PostgreSQL will continue to log into the
# renamed file (postmaster.log.1), and there will be no postmaster.log
# file around during that period.  We might have called the 'SELECT
# pg_rotate_logfile()' function in a postrotate script called here to
# force an immediate switchover after we roll the log files.  But even
# ignoring the possibility of race conditions with respect to PostgreSQL
# noticing on its own that it needs to open a new file, use of that
# function is restricted to a database superuser, and we don't want to
# invoke that level of privilege from within an automated script.
