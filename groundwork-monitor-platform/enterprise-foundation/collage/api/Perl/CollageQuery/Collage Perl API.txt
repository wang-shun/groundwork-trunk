The API is subdivided into four groups.


CollageQuery 
	new - Create the CollageQuery object. Required to use any of the following methods.
	destroy - Destroy's the CollageQuery object.  Should be called when the CollageQuery object is no longer needed.

CollageHostGroupQuery
	getServicesForHostGroup(String hostGroup) -  return a reference to a hash host-service-attributes for a designated host group
	getHostsForHostGroup(String hostGroup) - return a reference to a hash of all host names, device name for a designated host group
	getHostGroups() - return a reference to all hostgroup names, descriptions, 
	getHostGroup(String hgName) -  return a hash containing the attributes for a host group 


CollageHostQuery
	getServicesForHost(String host) - return an reference to a hash of all services-attributes for a host
	getHosts() - return a reference to a hash of all host-attributes
	getHostStatusForHost(String host) - return a hash of all the status attributes for a host
	getDeviceForHost(String host) - return a hash of the device attributes for a host

CollageServiceQuery
	getService(String serviceName, String hostName) - return a hash of service attributes
	getServices() - return a reference to a hash of host-service-attributes

CollageMonitorServerQuery
	getMonitorServers() - return a reference to a hash of monitorserver-attributes
	getHostsForMonitorServer(String MonitorServer) - return a reference to a hash of hosts for a designated monitorserver 
	getHostGroupsForMonitorServer(String MonitorServer) - return a reference to a hash of host groups-attributes

CollageEventQuery:   Returns a reference to a hash of events with the event ID as primary key and attributes as secondary key
	getEventsForDevice(String identification, String timeField, Date fromDate, Date toDate)
	getEventsForService(String serviceDescription, String HostName, String timeField, Date fromDate, Date toDate)
	getEventsForHost(String HostName, String timeField, Date fromDate, Date toDate)
Note: timeField (String) can be FirstInsertDate or LastInsertDate if it's null no range will be applied
