4 Installing Foundation 1.5
==============================

Foundation is now packaged as a web application running inside a servlet container. The binary
distribution (Foundation-1.5-full.tar.gz) includes Jetty (http://www.mortbay.org/) as the preferred
Servlet container.

If you have already a web container (Jetty/Tomcat) or if you have installed the previous full distribution
you can just download the updated war files for Foundation, Birt and the report server (Foundation-1.5-webapps.tar.gz) 

The distribution includes as well a report viewer (Eclipse Birt), the Foundation WebService API
and Foundation Admin Frontend.

Untar foundation-1.5-full.tar.gz into a directory of your choice.
The file includes the following sub-directories:
foundation
foundation/container
foundation/eclipse
foundation/database
foundation/feeder

4.1 Updating the web appllications (war files)
==============================================
The following sections describes how  to upgrade an existing Foundation installation. It assumes
that Jetty is used as the preferred servlet container. Any examples for command are for Jetty but 
could easaly replaced with commands for Tomcat.

Untar Foundation-1.5-webapps.tar.gz into a directory of your choice. The tar includes the following webapplications:
webapps/birt.war
webapps/foundation-reportserver.war
webapps/foundation-webapp.war

These files need to be copied into Jetty's webapps folder
Steps:
Stop the servlet container foundation/container/stop-foundation.sh

4.1 Configuring the servlet container
=====================================
By default the servlet container listens on port 8080. If you have already an application
running using this port you have to edit the Jetty config file which can be found in

	foundation/container/etc/foundation.xml
	           

4.2 Configuring the database
==========================
In the subdirectory foundation database are all scripts for creating the initial
database.

Step into the directory and run the scripts in the following order:

mysql -uroot mysql < create-production-db.sql
mysql -uroot GWCollageDB < GWCollageDB.sql
mysql -uroot GWCollageDB < GWCollage-Version.sql
mysql -uroot GWCollageDB < GWCollage-Console.sql
mysql -uroot GWCollageDB < GWCollage-State.sql
mysql -uroot GWCollageDB < GWCollage-Metadata.sql
mysql -uroot GWCollageDB < nagios-properties.sql
mysql -uroot GWCollageDB < system-properties.sql
mysql -uroot GWCollageDB < snmp-properties.sql

Note:
If you decide to use different credential for the database user (create-production-db.sql)
make sure that the config file in foundation/container/config/db.properties is updated

The entries should look like the following:

#Collage Datasource
connection.driver_class=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
collage.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost/GWCollageDB
collage.username=collage
collage.password=gwrk

4.3 Starting Foundation
=======================

Once the database is populated you can launch the application as following:

Step into foundation/container
./start-foundation.sh &

To stop the container just invoke
./stop-foundation.sh


5 Test Application / UI access
==============================
To check if the application is running just go to:

http://localhost:8080/foundation-webapp

This should bring up the overview page

For any trouble shooting check the log file in foundation/container/logs

6 Configuring Foundation for an existing Nagios 1.2 install
=========================================================
Adjust the path to the Nagios Status (status.log) file:
    Edit foundation/feeder/nagiso2collage_socket.pl and adjust the path. In
    the same file set the variable my $nagios_version to 1

Adjust the path to the Nagios event (nagios.log) files:
Edit ./foundation/feeder/nagiso2collage_event.pl and adjust the path


7 Configuring Foundation for an existing Nagios 2.0 install
=========================================================
Adjust the path to the Nagios Status (status.dat) file:
Edit foundation/feeder/nagios2collage_socket.pl and adjust the path

Adjust the path to the Nagios event (nagios.log) files:
Edit foundation/feeder/nagios2collage_event.pl and adjust the path

8 Run the Nagios feeders
=================================================

Once the feeder scripts have been updated make sure that the foundation
webapp is running (step 4.3) and then start the feeders from the foundation/feeder directory:

> ./nagios2collage_socket.pl &
> ./nagios2collage_event.pl &

9 Configuring Foundation Nagios feeder with Nagios running on a different server
==============================================================================
If Nagios is installed on a different server than Foundation the following steps are necessary
to configure the feeders:
    Copy the feeder scripts onto the server where nagios is running
    In addition to the above steps to set the version and the path you need to specify
    the server where Foundation is running by setting the variable my $thisnagios
    in both scripts.

	make sure the Foundation application is running (Step 4.3) 
   
    before the feeder scripts are started on the server with nagios
    > ./nagios2collage_socket.pl &
	> ./nagios2collage_event.pl &
