<h1>Why GroundWork Foundation?</h1>
<p>
<a href="http://www.groundworkopensource.com/community/">GroundWork Foundation </a> is an IT management data abstraction layer and development platform. The Foundation data model allows the integration of any state, event, and performance data, independent of the Monitoring Application that produces it. This offers the possibility to store data for additional systems, including open source and commercial monitoring systems, databases, and even hardware, such as detectors or sensors. It also allows the integration of Application Monitoring data known as MBeans.</li>
<ul><li>Foundation 1.1 has been enhanced to integrate more diverse data sources into a single data store. This was achieved by introducing properties for describing the data points instead of using database fields for each measurement. The APIs and the existing feeders are backward compatible with previous versions.
<li>Foundation 1.5 added a Web Service API using Apache Axis, reporting capabilities providing an Eclipse ODA datasource leveraging the Foundation Web Service API for creating <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/birt/phoenix/">Eclipse BIRT</a> reports and packaging as a web application that allows deployment into Tomcat or Jetty servlet containers.
Using Web Services and the deployment as an web application is a huge step forward to a distributed load balanced data integration platform.
</li>
<li>Much work went into the performance enhancements. The message throughput was significantly improved by applying the following techniques:</li>
<ul><li>Using Java 5 components (Thread Pools / Concurrent classes)</li>
<li>Using hash keys for consolidating messages instead of lookups</li>
<li>Using internally a dedicated channel for Event Messages</li>
</ul>
</ul></p>
<h1>Status:</h1>
<ul>
<li>Current Version: Release 1.5</li>
<li>Libraries are available and can be referenced by the Maven build tool at the <a href="http://www.groundworkopensource.com/maven/repository">GroundWork repository </a></li>
</ul>

<h1>Main features:</h1>
<ul>
<li>Foundation Web Service API using SOAP</li>
<li>Web UI for managing the underlying datamodel such as Application Types, Properties and managed hosts</li>
<li>Eclipse ODA datasource interacting with Foundation Web Service that allows creating <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/birt/phoenix/">Eclipse BIRT</a> reports</li>
<li>Packaged as web application deployable into Tomcat 5.5.x or Jetty 5.x</li>
<li>Binary distribution as a complete application including Foundation, Eclipse Birt Report viewer and Jetty servlet container.</li>
<li>Source code is available in the <a href="http://archive.groundworkopensource.com/groundwork-opensource/trunk/foundation">Public Subversion Source repository</a></li>
<li>Pluggable data collectors / normalizers for integrating any monitoring data into a common data model</li>
<li>Property based data model that can be easily extended with Application specific data points</li>
<li>Feeder API that allows to extend, modify and update the underlying data model at run time.</li>
</ul>
<h1>GroundWork Foundation 1.5 Binary distributions</h1>

Groundwork Foundation has the following pre-requisites:
<ul>
<li>MySQL database 5.0. MySQL can be downloaded for from the <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/5.0.html"> MySQL site</a></li>
<li>Java 5.0 is required. Older version of Java won't work. Download the latest <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp">Java 5.0 JDK from Sun</a>. Install Java and make sure that JAVA_HOME variable is set and the java executable $JAVA_HOME/bin/java is included in the path.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>For detailed instructions how to deploy and configure Foundation see the <a href="INSTALL-BINARY.txt">INSTALL-BINARY</a> which is as well included in the package.</li>
</ul>
<h1>How can I help?</h1>
The 1.5 Release is out the door and we are working on enhancements and new features. We are still looking for contributions from the Open Source community, so if you like to help to enhance Foundation, please consider contributing your code for inclusion into the project.
Below is a list of features under development (ToDos):
<ul>
<li>Enhancing the WEB UI (servlet/portlets) for completeness.</li>
<li>JMS Listener -- Embedded topic server that would accept feeder messages from any JMS subscriber.</li>
<li>Adapters for any type of Monitoring data (JMX, log4j) or from other Open Source or commercial tools</li>
<li>Support for PostgreSQL, Derby, MS-SQL, Oracle, or other databases.</li>
</ul>
