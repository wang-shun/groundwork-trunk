# second minimum, 300 second maximum.  The longer the time, the larger
# the bundles of updates.  Setting this too long could result in a

# when the unexpected happens and automatically restart to recover.  This
# checking imposes a modest amount of extra database and analysis load that
# scales with the size of your monitoring setup, so you might not want to
# run it on every cycle.  But you do want to run it often enough to catch
# trouble relatively soon if it arises, so the status feeder can recognize
# it, restart, and either self-heal or generate events to warn of the
# problem.  Once a sync check fails in some cycle, it will continue to run
# on every cycle until it succeeds, regardless of the setting here.  Set
# this to 0 if you want to completely disable this checking; you would only
# do that under extreme duress.  Set this to 1 if you want to be paranoid
# and always check on every cycle.

#
# Certain data fields are processed by the status feeder but are not
# forwarded by default to Foundation because most customers never access

# reduces the network, processing, and storage load.  A few customers
# have uses for these values, though, so here we provide a means to
# control whether particular non-default fields are sent.

# Data fields are classified into different sending categories, described
# below.  If you do not want to send any optional fields for a given sending
# category, leave the corresponding setting as an empty string ("").  If you
# do want to send some optional fields in a given sending category, list the
# Foundation field names here in a quoted, space-separated list.  For example,
# you might configure the following:
#
#     send_on_service_timing_change = "TimeOK TimeWarning TimeCritical TimeUnknown"
#
# IMPORTANT:  To keep the system load down, only configure the non-default
# fields you know you will actually use.
#
# The sending categories are as follows:
#
# send_in_any_host_message
# send_in_any_service_message
#     All of these fields are always included in any message sent for the
#     object.  A change in any of these fields will force a message for the
#     host or service to be sent.  These categories have no support for any
#     non-default fields, so they are not configurable below.
#
# send_on_host_data_change
# send_on_service_data_change
#     These fields are only sent if their individual values have changed.
#     A change in any of these fields will force a message for the host or
#     service to be sent.  The non-default fields that can be specified
#     for these categories are marked above as "data change".
#
# send_on_host_timing_change
# send_on_service_timing_change
#     These fields are only sent if their individual values have changed.
#     However, a change in any of these fields will by itself only force
#     a message for the host or service to be sent if it is time for a
#     heartbeat.  Otherwise, the change will not be posted to Foundation
#     until either a data change occurs for this host or service, or the
#     next heartbeat cycle occurs.  The non-default fields that can be
#     specified for these categories are marked above as "timing change".

# ----------------------------------------------------------------
# Options for sending state data to parent/standby server(s)
# ----------------------------------------------------------------

# State data may be sent to one or more parent/parent-standby servers in
# addition to a local Foundation database.  Such data is sent in three
# possible forms, representing escalating levels of insistence.  The
# exact logic is somewhat more complex, but this gives you the idea.
#
# * State changes are sent to the remote system whenever a state change
#   within Nagios is detected, and thereafter roughly as long as the
#   state is still "soft" within Nagios.  This last condition allows the
#   parent system to mirror the local Nagios logic that determines when
#   soft states turn into hard states.
#
# * Heartbeats are sent to the remote system on a periodic basis, and
#   include any state data which has not been sent since the last
#   heartbeat (roughly, because it has not changed or not been in a soft
#   state after a change, and thus has not been part of a state-change
#   message), but which has been checked since the last heartbeat (and
#   found to be still in the same state).
#
# * Full dumps may be sent to the remote system on a periodic basis.
#   These dumps include all state data, regardless of whether it has
#   been checked or has changed since the last full dump.  Such dumps
#   are used as a kind of fallback measure to ensure that the local and
#   remote systems stay sychronized over the long term, no matter what
#   kinds of transient failures might occur in the short term.
#
# Sending of state changes and heartbeats is enabled in tandem, because
# it only makes sense to send both kinds of data or neither.  Sending
# of full dumps is enabled independently, via the full-dump interval
# (though such dumps will only be sent if sending of state changes and
# heartbeats is also enabled).
#
# State data may be sent via either direct NSCA (send_nsca) invocations,
# or indirectly by using the GDMA spooler.  These channels may be
# independently controlled here, using options below.  Most of the
# configuration for the GDMA spooler, including where it will send the
# state data, is done separately in the spooler's own configuration
# file.
#
# Finally, note that sending state data to parent/standby server(s)
# is only supported if smart_update (configured above) is true.

# ----------------------------------------------------------------
