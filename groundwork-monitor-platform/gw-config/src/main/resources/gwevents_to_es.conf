# Endpoints for this feeder means which GroundWork servers logmessages (events) will be taken from.
# Endpoints will be processed in the order the are specified here.
# At least one needs to be defined. More than one can be defined by repeating the endpoint directive.
# The format is : 
#   endpoint = <simple endpoint name>:<path to it's configuration file>
# The <simple endpoint name> is not a hostname but just an identifier referenced in logging by the feeder. 
# The endpoint hostname itself is defined in the associated configuration file.
# For clarity, it's recommended to have this name be the hostname of the endpoint.
# The <path to it's configuration file> needs to be a fully qualified filename.
