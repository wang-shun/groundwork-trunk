Instructions for installing the Perl modules to enable Remedy Integration into GroundWork.

Step 1: Untar the Remedy Perl modules located in the cpan directory to a temporary directory.

		- ARSperl-1.91.tgz
		- Remedy-ARSTools-1.tar.gz

Step 2: Build and install

	*  The modules must be built in the following order:

		1. ARSperl-1.91 

		   ****************************************************************** 
		      This presumes that the AR C API header and library files
		      are already installed in /usr/ar/api on the target machine.

		      Be sure to install these before continuing further.
		   ******************************************************************

		2. Remedy-ARSTools-1


	*  Builds should be performed as root.

	*  Each module can be built by issuing the following: 

		-  /usr/local/groundwork/helpdesk/perl/bin/perl Makefile.PL

	   	- Edit the Makefile (necessary for 64bit architectures):

		    Change 'CC = cc' to 'CC = gcc -m32'
		    Change 'LD = cc' to 'LD = gcc -m32'

	   	  This forces gcc to build and link against 32 bit object files on 64 bit architectures.

		- make

		- make install

Step 3: Set up correct ownership

	* chown -R nagios:nagios /usr/local/groundwork/helpdesk/perl
