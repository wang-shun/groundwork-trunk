This README describes how to install the Perl components of LogBridge child server.
The following KB article has detail instructions for all of the other parts of this installation

Important Version Note
----------------------
This version of the logbridge feeders was developed under 7.0.2 patch 1. 
It has not been developed or tested under version 7.1.0. 
Given changes to 7.1.0, including RAPID, this version will need some updates to work with 7.1.0.

Prerequisites
-------------
A working ELK environment (redis, logstash shipper(s), elasticsearch, kibana)

File                            Description                                                     Destination (ownership is nagios:nagios unless noted otherwise)
----                            -----------                                                     ---------------------------------------------------------------
logstash_feeder.pl              Runs searches against elasticsearch, feeds GW                   /usr/local/groundwork/foundation/feeder
logstash_feeder.conf.default    Default config for logstash_feeder.pl                           /usr/local/groundwork/config
elastic_scanner.pl              Reads events from GW logmessage table, feeds into Elasticearch  /usr/local/groundwork/foundation/feeder
elastic_scanner.conf.default    Default config for elastic_scanner.pl                           /usr/local/groundwork/config
Feeder.pm                       A 7.0.2 updated Feeder.pm module                                /usr/local/groundwork/perl/lib/site_perl/5.8.9/GW/Feeder.pm ( but see "GWME integration" notes below )
elastic_scanner                 An init.d / service script                                      /etc/init.d (ownership root:root) ( but see "GWME integration" notes below )
logstash_feeder                 An init.d / service script                                      /etc/init.d (ownership root:root) ( but see "GWME integration" notes below )
deploy.supervise                A helper script for installing services in GWME system          See "GWME integration" notes below


Notes 
-----
- during operation, you can change config file contents, and they will automatically be read in withourt requiring a restart of the associated application
- both of the default config files included here have the following settings :
- enable_processing = no 
- the same health_hostgroup = LogBridgeHealth 
- note about license limit checking 
--- in version 7.0.2, license checking is done using add_check . Add_check doesn't work quite properly.
--- In both configuration files, license_check = remote and monitoring_server = gw-parent , so change gw-parent after installing, and read the config file notes about license checking
- GWME integration
--- These versions of the feeders were designed to live in a GWME-free environment. In some cases, they need to run in a GWME environment though. Do this as follows :
------ Since Feeder.pm version here is ahead of and needs merging with 702 stock, the following should be done :
--------- a) install Feeder.pm into /usr/local/groundwork/foundation/feeder/log-hub/GW
--------- b) after installing the pl scripts, modify them both to pick up the Feeder.pm : use lib '/usr/local/groundwork/foundation/feeder/log-hub'; use GW::Feeder qv('0.3.1.3');
--------- c) since these scripts are living in the GWME environment, make them GW supervised services :
------------- i) do not install the elastic_scanner and logstash_feeder init.d scripts
------------- ii) run the deploy.supervise script - this will install the two feeder scripts as supervised services
--------- d) change location of logfiles for permission reasons :
------------- i) logstash_feeder.conf : logfile = /usr/local/groundwork/core/services/feeder-logstash_feeder/log/main/log
------------- i) elastic_scanner.conf : logfile = /usr/local/groundwork/core/services/feeder-elastic_scanner/log/main/log
--------- e) change license checking more in configs from remote to local, and monitoring_server = localhost


Logstash Feeder Specific Notes
------------------------------
- an example set of searches has been provided, based around the demo. These will need customizing for customers.

Notes About init.d Scripts
--------------------------
- after installing, do a chkconfig --add elastic_scanner, and chkconfig --add logstash_feeder
- do work but need more work eg issuing the stop command will actually kill all processes with the $APP_PROGRAM string (including vim if you're editing) etc
