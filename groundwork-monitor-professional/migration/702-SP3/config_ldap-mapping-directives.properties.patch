+# Mapping of GroundWork memberships to LDAP groups
+# Users in the groups will automatically get memberships for the group.
+
+## Now map groups to the memberships
+#Using the default Groups defined in GroundWork Monitor
+#User can add any LDAP group/membership definition which will
+#be synchronized when a user that is member of a group logs in.
+
+#Notes:
+# If you define an LDAP group make sure that the page/layout and portlet
+# permissions for the Group are defined in the portal
+#
+# A good practicse is to assign a user to two LDAP groups. One that has the default
+# permissions (GWUser) and the other with specific pages, Hostgroups or Servicegroups

+#Portal admin group mapping
