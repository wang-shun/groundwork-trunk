These assets were for development of a BMC FootPrints ticketing system integration for UCB. 
They didn't require it in the end.
However, this laid some foundation for this or other ticketing system integrations in the future.

Files :

	- tix.pl - the main NoMa script - read the comments at the top for more details about this work
	- NoMa.yaml - footprints enabled NoMa.yaml - will still need to add the handler in the sqlite3 db directly too
	- RAPID.pm - updated with s/get_propertytypes routines to support this integration
	- emulate_noma.pl - helper script for sending in noma notifications to trigger things to work
	- send_noma_test.pl - another helper script for sending in noma notifications to trigger things to work (deprecated I think by emulate_noma.pl)
