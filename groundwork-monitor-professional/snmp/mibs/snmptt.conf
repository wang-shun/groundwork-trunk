EVENT coldStart .1.3.6.1.6.3.1.1.5.1 "Status Events" Normal
FORMAT Device reinitialized (coldStart)
#EXEC qpage -f TRAP notifygroup1 "Device reinitialized (coldStart)"
SOCKET localhost:4913;localhost:5667;$x;$X;$aA;$A;$o;$O;$s;$N;$c;$+*;$Fz
SDESC
A coldStart trap signifies that the SNMPv2 entity, acting
in an agent role, is reinitializing itself and that its
configuration may have been altered.

#EXEC qpage -f TRAP notifygroup1 "Device reinitialized (warmStart)"
SOCKET localhost:4913;localhost:5667;$x;$X;$aA;$A;$o;$O;$s;$N;$c;$+*;$Fz
SDESC
A warmStart trap signifies that the SNMPv2 entity, acting
in an agent role, is reinitializing itself such that its
configuration is unaltered.

EVENT linkDown .1.3.6.1.6.3.1.1.5.3 "Status Events" Normal
FORMAT Link down on interface $1.  Admin state: $2.  Operational state: $3 
#EXEC qpage -f TRAP notifygroup1 "Link down on interface $1.  Admin state: $2.  Operational state: $3"
SOCKET localhost:4913;localhost:5667;$x;$X;$aA;$A;$o;$O;$s;$N;$c;$+*;$Fz
SDESC
A linkDown trap signifies that the SNMP entity, acting in
an agent role, has detected that the ifOperStatus object for
one of its communication links is about to enter the down
state from some other state (but not from the notPresent
state).  This other state is indicated by the included value
of ifOperStatus.

EVENT linkUp .1.3.6.1.6.3.1.1.5.4 "Status Events" Normal
FORMAT Link up on interface $1.  Admin state: $2.  Operational state: $3
#EXEC qpage -f TRAP notifygroup1 "Link up on interface $1.  Admin state: $2.  Operational state: $3"
SOCKET localhost:4913;localhost:5667;$x;$X;$aA;$A;$o;$O;$s;$N;$c;$+*;$Fz
SDESC
A linkUp trap signifies that the SNMP entity, acting in an
agent role, has detected that the ifOperStatus object for
one of its communication links left the down state and
transitioned into some other state (but not into the
notPresent state).  This other state is indicated by the
included value of ifOperStatus.

EVENT authenticationFailure .1.3.6.1.6.3.1.1.5.5 "Status Events" Normal
FORMAT SNMP authentication failure
#EXEC qpage -f TRAP notifygroup1 "SNMP authentication failure"
SOCKET localhost:4913;localhost:5667;$x;$X;$aA;$A;$o;$O;$s;$N;$c;$+*;$Fz
SDESC
An authenticationFailure trap signifies that the SNMPv2
entity, acting in an agent role, has received a protocol
message that is not properly authenticated.  While all
implementations of the SNMPv2 must be capable of generating
this trap, the snmpEnableAuthenTraps object indicates
whether this trap will be generated.
