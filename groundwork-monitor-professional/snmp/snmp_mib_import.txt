Instructions for installing MIBs into SNMPTT

1. Copy mib file into directory "/usr/local/groundwork/share/snmp/mibs".

2. Change to that directory with command 
	cd /usr/local/groundwork/share/snmp/mibs

2. Enter command "export MIBS=ALL"

3. Create the new conf file with the following command where MIBFILE is the name of the new MIB.
	a.  export MIBS=ALL
	b.  /usr/local/groundwork/bin/snmpttconvertmib --in=MIBFILE   --out=MIBFILE.conf --format_desc=3 --exec='/usr/local/groundwork/nagios/eventhandlers/gwprocesstrap.pl "$x" "$X" "$aA" "$A" "$o" "$O" "$s" "$N" "$c" "$+*" '

Note: If you need to rerun the command, delete the conf file. If it exists, entries will be appended.

4. If you want to customize the trap process, edit the EXEC entry in the MIBFILE.conf file:
	a. To modify the output text for the trap, edit the text.
	b. To modify the severity for the trap, change the $s variable to any one the following:
		NORMAL, OK, MINOR, WARNING, MAJOR, CRITICAL, UNKNOWN

5. Move the conf file into the configuration directory with the command:
	mv MIBFILE.conf /usr/local/groundwork/etc/snmp/

6. Add the MIBFILE.conf file to the snmptt ini file "/usr/local/groundwork/etc/snmp/snmptt.ini". Near the end of the file in the TrapFiles section, add to the snmptt_conf_files directive.

	[TrapFiles]
	# A list of snmptt.conf files (this is NOT the snmptrapd.conf file).  The COMPLETE path
	# and filename.  Ex: '/etc/snmp/snmptt.conf'
	snmptt_conf_files = <<END
	/usr/local/groundwork/etc/snmp/snmptt.conf
	.
	.
	/usr/local/groundwork/etc/snmp/MIBFILE.conf
	END	

7. Restart snmptt with the command:
	/etc/init.d/snmptt restart
