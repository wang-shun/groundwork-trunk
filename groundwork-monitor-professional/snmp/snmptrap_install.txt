Prerequisites - add from GW Monitor 4-8g build.
 - Perl Config::IniFiles module


1. Create directory /usr/local/groundwork/etc/snmp for all snmp configuration files.

2. Create directory /usr/local/groundwork/var/log/snmp for all snmptrapd and snmptt log and debug files.

3. Create directory /usr/local/groundwork/var/spool/snmptt for snmptrapd output files. This directory is referenced in snmptt.ini file. The snmptt.ini file is referenced in the snmptt init.d script and the snmptrapd.conf file.

4. Copy snmptt to /usr/local/grounwork/sbin.  
	- Modified to use /usr/local/groundwork/bin/perl.
	- Modified to reference spool directory /usr/local/groundwork/var/spool/snmptt
	- Modified to use log directory /usr/local/groundwork/var/log/snmp

5. Copy snmptthandler to /usr/local/grounwork/sbin.  
	- Modified to use /usr/local/groundwork/bin/perl.

6. Copy snmptt.ini to /usr/local/groundwork/etc/snmp/. 
	- Modified to reference groundwork directories.

7. Copy snmptrapd.conf to /usr/local/groundwork/etc/snmp/. 
	- Modified to reference groundwork snmptthandler.
	- Modified to use groundwork snmptt.ini file

8. Copy snmptt.conf to /usr/local/groundwork/etc/snmp/. 
	- All MIBs must be imported into this file.

9. Copy init.d script snmptt to /etc/init.d/.  
	- Modified to reference groundwork directories, 
	- Modified to use daemon startup 
	- Modified to reference groundwork snmptt.ini file.

	- Modified to output log in groundowrk var/log/snmp directory (can take out after debug).  
	- Do chkconfig to start automatically.

11. copy snmpttconvertmib script to /usr/local/grounwork/sbin.
	- Modified to use /usr/local/groundwork/bin/perl --
	- Modified to execute snmptranslate as /usr/local/groundwork/bin/snmptranslate
