Setting up the GroundWork Monitor Spool capability
==================================================

GroundWork Monitor Spool 0.0.1 is only compatible with the GroundWork
Monitor 6.3 release.  This package is to be installed only on child
servers whose object status-check results are to be forwarded to one
or more parent servers.


Install the GroundWork Monitor Spool RPM
----------------------------------------

Once you have installed GroundWork Monitor 6.3 Enterprise, perform the
following steps in a terminal window as user root:

1.  Install the Monitor Spool RPM, using a command similar to this:

	rpm -Uvh groundwork-monitor-spool-0.0.1-17083.noarch.rpm

    Note:  This RPM replaces the nagios2collage_socket.pl feeder with
    a revised version.	To make it possible for this RPM to be removed,
    the first installation of the RPM saves a copy of the feeder script
    in a sibling nagios2collage_socket.pl.pre_spooler file.

    An uninstall of the groundwork-monitor-spool package will
    automatically restore the original file from this copy, if it
    still exists.

2.  Edit this new configuration file:

	/usr/local/groundwork/config/status-feeder.properties

    In particular, if the spooling mechanism which is the point of this
    package is to be invoked, you will want to edit this line:

	send_state_changes_by_gdma = false

    In contrast, this line:

	send_state_changes_by_nsca = false

    should be left as-is, since the point of this RPM package is to use
    the GDMA spooler instead of direct NSCA invocations.

3.  Edit this new configuration file:

	/usr/local/groundwork/gdma/config/gwmon_{yourhost}.cfg

    In particular, change the value of Spooler_Status from "off" to
    "on", and uncomment and define the Target_Server so it points to
    this child's parent server(s).

4.  Edit this configuration file (as pointed to by the Spooler_NSCA_Config
    setting in the gwmon_{yourhost}.cfg file):

	/usr/local/groundwork/common/etc/send_nsca.cfg

    and set the desired parameters.  The settings of password and
    encryption_method here must match the settings of listener_password
    and listener_encryption_method in the bronx.cfg file on the parent
    server(s).	Note that, if this same send_nsca.cfg file is used for
    this purpose (forwarding check results to the parent server) as is
    used any for other purposes for which send_nsca is called on the
    child server, all parties on the child server (and their respective
    recipient partners) must share the same configuration parameters.
    If instead a separate configuration is desired for this spooling of
    results to the parent server(s), a recommended path for the alternate
    configuration file would be:

	/usr/local/groundwork/gdma/config/send_nsca.cfg

    which you would need to set as the value of Spooler_NSCA_Config in
    the gwmon_{yourhost}.cfg file.

    It is recommended that you set:

	wide_plugin_output=on

    in the send_nsca.cfg file, for efficient operation even with short
    plugin output.

5.  Bounce gwservices on the child server so all the feeders get restarted
    and pick up their respective new configuration settings.

6.  Verify that host and service check results are being forwarded from
    the child server to the parent server(s).
