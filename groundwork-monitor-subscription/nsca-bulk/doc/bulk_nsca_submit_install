These instructions refer to the groundwork-nsca-bulk package, version 2.0.1.

Here's how to install and use the bulk_nsca_submit.pl script, to aggregate
child-server service results to be sent to the parent monitoring server:

1.  The script gets installed on each child server where you wish to have the
    bulk-submit capability available.

    If you install from a tarball, place bulk_nsca_submit.pl into
    /usr/local/groundwork/nagios/eventhandlers/ on the child server.  Then:

	chown nagios:nagios /usr/local/groundwork/nagios/eventhandlers/bulk_nsca_submit.pl
	chmod 0755          /usr/local/groundwork/nagios/eventhandlers/bulk_nsca_submit.pl

    If you install from an RPM instead (the preferred method), this will be
    done for you.

2.  Within GroundWork Monitor, under Configuration -> Commands -> New,
    create a Nagios command to invoke the bulk-submit script:

        Click the "user2" check-box (next to "/usr/local/groundwork/nagios/eventhandlers").
	Press "Next >>" at the bottom of the screen.
	Fill in the form:

	    Name:          bulk_nsca_submit
	    Type:          other
	    Command line:  $USER2$/bulk_nsca_submit.pl w.x.y.z 5667 10

		(where:
		    w.x.y.z is the IP address of the parent GroundWork server
		    5667 is the NSCA port on the parent server
		    10 (seconds) is the send_nsca timeout
		)

	Click "Add".

3.  Set up the child GroundWork server configuration as follows.  Navigate
    to Configuration -> Groups -> Groups -> {select a group} -> 'Nagios cfg',
    for your chosen child server's group.  Click 'Save and Next >>' at the
    bottom of the page twice, which takes you to a frame titled
    '{groupname} Nagios Configuration Page 3'.

        Uncheck 'Obsess over services'.
	Uncheck 'Obsess over hosts'.
	Check 'Process performance data'.
	Set 'Host perfdata command' to NULL (blank).
	Set 'Service perfdata command' to NULL (blank).
	Set 'Host performance data file' to NULL (empty).
	Set 'Service performance data file' to
	    '/usr/local/groundwork/nagios/eventhandlers/check_data.log'
	Set 'Host performance data file template' to NULL (empty).
	Set 'Service performance data file template' to
	    '$HOSTNAME$\t$SERVICEDESC$\t$SERVICESTATEID$\t$SERVICEOUTPUT$|$SERVICEPERFDATA$'.
	Set 'Host performance data file mode' to 'a'.
	Set 'Service performance data file mode' to 'a'.
	Set 'Host performance data file processing interval' to '0'.
	Set 'Service performance data file processing interval' to '30'.
	Set 'Host performance data file processing command' to NULL (blank).
	Set 'Service performance data file processing command to 'bulk_nsca_submit'.

    Click 'Save and Next >>'.

4.  When using the stock NSCA 2.4 that comes with GW 5.1.3 or earlier, update
    /usr/local/groundwork/etc/nsca.cfg on the parent GroundWork server to allow
    connections from the child (the "allowed_hosts" option).  When using NSCA
    2.7.2, either supplied as a special replacement for use with GW 5.1.3 or in
    a later GW release, you must instead modify the system files to allow the
    "nsca" service to be accessed from each child server:

	In /etc/services, literally as shown:
	    nsca            5667/tcp        # Nagios NSCA

	In /etc/hosts.allow (subtitute your local IP address(es)):
	    nsca : child1_ip_address child2_ip_address

	In /etc/hosts.deny, literally as shown:
	    nsca : ALL

5.  Commit the config changes to the child GroundWork server.

6.  Look at /usr/local/groundwork/nagios/var/log/bulk_nsca_submit.log
    for debug output by editing the script and setting debug=1 (for simple
    log output) for debug=2 (for full, voluminous log output).  Turn this
    off after verifying operation and that messages are making it to the
    parent.

7.  Possibly, tune the number of messages to be submitted with each
    invocation of send_nsca.  Initially, it's coded in the script as 200.
