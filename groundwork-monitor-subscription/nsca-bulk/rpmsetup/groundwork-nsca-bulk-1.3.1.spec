# The construction of this spec file is a bit unusual in that it is
# intended to be self-contained; that is, we don't want to depend on
# the particular user's dot-files (~/.rpmrc or ~/.rpmmacros) and build
# structure (pre-established ~/rpmbuild/*/ directories).  Also, we don't
# start with a source RPM or tarball.  Rather, we assume the source code
# is already splayed out, and all we're trying to do at this stage is to
# construct the RPM(s).

# ================================================================

# Note:  If you need to debug the specfile or the associated macro files,
# it may help to invoke the dump macro.  Uncomment the following line and
# change the at-sign to a percent sign (rpmbuild invokes macros even when
# they are embedded in comments, so we couldn't just leave a commented-out,
# directly-useable invocation here).  That will print out all the macro
# values for your inspection.
# @dump

# Note:	The "Source" specification is only used to build a source RPM.  In the code

# FIX MINOR:  We should put the BuildPrereq back, once we disable the
# "rpmbuild --dbpath" option in the makefile.
# BuildPreReq: patch

# We require at least one of these packages as a pre-requisite for the
# groundwork-nsca-bulk RPM because we're adding certain new files
# and directories to the installation without creating the parent directories
# ourselves.
# FIX LATER:  We have not yet delved into exactly which of these possible
# external RPMs actually contain the pathnames, files, and databases we need.
# FIX LATER:  We might be able to relax the version constraints specified here.
PreReq: groundwork-foundation-pro >= 1.6.1, groundwork-monitor-core >= 5.1.3, groundwork-monitor-pro >= 5.1.3

%description
This software extends the base GroundWork Monitor product by
supplying a Perl script which bundles up a lot of host-check and
service-check data from a performance-data log, and sends it very
efficiently to Nagios, through high-volume connections to NSCA.

# ================================================================

%prep

%make_all_rpm_build_dirs

# WARNING:  The "%setup -D" option is critical here, so we don't recursively
# delete the entire source file tree before the build can even begin.
%setup -D -T -n %(echo $PWD)

# Here we filter out unwanted Requires, which are known to be provided in the
# base GroundWork Monitor packages which are part of our own package's PreReq, 
# but which are not yet part of the Provides declarations in those packages.
# So we're working around a deficiency, but because of the PreReq directive
# above we're not actually defeating the dependency analysis at install time.

# In the present case, we just need to handle certain Perl modules.

# The script below references the original __perl_requires macro,
# so we cannot redefine it here before creating that script.
