This directory contains the following patch for the CGI::Ajax package:

CGI_Ajax.pm.patch

We are applying this patch to suppress the following message from the
CGI 4.32 package, which now complains about certain calls in order to
get developers to look carefully at their use of the CGI routines.  This
message shows up in our framework.log file if the patch is not applied.

    cgi: runCGI (stderr):CGI::param called in list context from
	/usr/local/groundwork/perl/lib/vendor_perl/5.24.0/CGI/Ajax.pm line 485,
	this can lead to vulnerabilities. See the warning in
	"Fetching the value or values of a single named parameter"
	at /usr/local/groundwork/perl/lib/vendor_perl/5.24.0/CGI.pm line 412.

We have looked at the CGI::Ajax code, and it has no vulnerability at
this location, so we simply fix it to call the multi_param() routine
instead if it is available, so the message is not produced.
