This directory contains the following patch for the Nmap::Scanner 1.0 package:

Nmap::Scanner-1.0.patch

The Nmap::Scanner 1.0 package straight from CPAN has a variety of issues.

(*) It relies too much on undef, which throws "Use of uninitialized value"
    warnings from various places.

(*) It does not properly XML-encode certain characters, notably ampersand,
    that it receives from nmap.

(*) When it does try to encode entities, it uses HTML encoding instead of
    XML encoding or numeric entity encoding, which means that inappropriate
    (non-XML) entities may be referenced.

(*) It mixes up <nmap-err> and </nmap-msg> tags.

I have run a lot of tests and addressed all the instances of such problems
found in that testing.  The resulting patch is captured here as the
Nmap::Scanner-1.0.patch file.  For simplicity, the patch uses the Perl
"//" operator, first available in Perl 5.10.
