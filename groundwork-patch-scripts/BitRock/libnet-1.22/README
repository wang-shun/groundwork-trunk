The Net::Domain.pm.resolv.patch in this directory is adopted from:
https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=60729

However, that patch is now considered to be obsolete (GDMA-270).
Instead, we now provide a complete replacement Domain.pm file,
that addresses both the original reported problem and several other
issues with the Net::Domain implementation.  This copy of Domain.pm
has been pushed upstream to the Net::Domain (libnet) maintainers:
https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=60729#txn-912045

We recently (January 2012) found a problem with our previous full-file
copy of Domain.pm, and have checked a revised version into Subversion
for inclusion into GWMEE 6.6.1 and eventually into the next release
of GDMA.  This revised copy has now (March 2012) been pushed upstream
to the Net::Domain (libnet) maintainers, in CPAN bug 60729:
https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=60729#txn-1045971
We have also referenced that fixed file in the related CPAN bug 73410:
https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=73410#txn-1045974

See also comments from another user, who claims our fixed version
still does not act correctly under some circumstances:
https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=60729#txn-1100129
https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=60729#txn-1100132

October 2014:  We will be addressing that user's complaint, to the
extent that it might or might not be valid given that he's asking that
the package still yield the correct response after him having corrupted
the data sources on which the answer is based, not in the libnet-1.22
release, but via patches to a later release, starting with libnet-3.02.
We will also be working with the libnet maintainer to consolidate all
fixes and publish them in the standard distribution, so we can stop
maintaining our own patches.
