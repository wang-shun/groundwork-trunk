October 21, 2014:

The Domain.pm-3.02.1 file in this directory is adapted from the changes
we originally made against libnet-1.22 and posted here:
https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=60729#txn-1045971
We have now gone further and ported those changes into the libnet-3.02
release, which is current as of this writing.

See also comments from another user, who claims our fixed version for
libnet-1.22 still does not act correctly under some circumstances:
https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=60729#txn-1100129
https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=60729#txn-1100132

We will be addressing that user's complaint, to the extent that it
might or might not be valid given that he's asking that the package
still yield the correct response after him having corrupted the data
sources on which the answer is based.

The Domain.pm-3.02.1 file in this directory constitutes our first cut
of folding in our patches from Net/Domain.pm in the libnet-1.22 release
into the libnet-3.02 release.  It also provides support for callbacks,
which may be useful for debugging when things go wrong.  This is the
copy that we are folding into the GDMA 2.4.0 release.  We are also in
contact with the new libnet maintainer, and will take some extra effort
to fold in fixes to all other known issues and push those upstream.
That should get our changes published in the standard distribution,
so we can stop maintaining our own patches.
