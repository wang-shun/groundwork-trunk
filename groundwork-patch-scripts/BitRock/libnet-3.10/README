November 14, 2016:

The Domain.pm-3.10.1 file in this directory is adapted from the
changes we originally made against libnet-1.22 and posted here:
https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=60729#txn-1045971
We then went further and ported those changes into the libnet-3.02
release.  And now we have brought those exact same changes into
the libnet-3.10 release, which is current as of this writing.

See also comments from another user, who claims our fixed version for
libnet-1.22 still does not act correctly under some circumstances:
https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=60729#txn-1100129
https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=60729#txn-1100132

We will be addressing that user's complaint, to the extent that it
might or might not be valid given that he's asking that the package
still yield the correct response after him having corrupted the data
sources on which the answer is based.

The Domain.pm-3.10.1 file in this directory constitutes our first cut
of folding in our patches from Net/Domain.pm in the libnet-1.22 release
into the libnet-3.10 release.  It also provides support for callbacks,
which may be useful for debugging when things go wrong.  This is the
copy that we are folding into the GWMEE 7.1.1 release and also the GDMA
2.5.0 release.

In the past, we were also in contact with the new libnet maintainer, and
intended to take some extra effort to fold in fixes to all other known
issues and push those upstream.  That never happened, but it ought to now.
And part of that effort should be to adopt whatever debug-trace strategy
is used by other modules in the libnet distribution, so the entire Perl
community is comfortable with our approach.  It is especially important
to get concurrence on this because libnet (and thus Net::Domain) is part
of the Perl Core.  That should get our changes published in the standard
distribution, so we can stop maintaining our own patches.

Here's a complete list of all the bugs I know of reported against the
Net::Domain package, that we should fix in a consolidated patch:

https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=53559
https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=60729
https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=69238
https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=73410
https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=94153
https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=115704

We also need to address the issue we have seen in the field, in that a
host.domain name is pulled apart and then portions of the start and end
pieces are pasted back together in looping that tends to paste the wrong
pieces together first.  This can end up constructing some fully qualified
hostname that happens to match some undesired host out on the Internet
instead of the desired host.  The code should be inverted so it instead
first tries various combinations that are likely to be locally correct.
And the original failure mode needs to be documented so folks understand
the bad things that might happen and how the revised code does its best
to sidestep them.

I suspect it might also help to support a set of package variables that
could be used to control the order in which certain tests are made
by the Net::Domain routines, in case the standard ordering produces
poor results.  (We don't want to be subject to whatever vagaries of
implementation happened to work in the original developer's context,
but not in contexts that we encounter in the field.)  Perhaps some small
local state machine is appropriate, with configurable path choices.
I imagine that we will end up posting to the Perl mailing lists before
we're completely done developing this part of the upgrade.

See GWMON-12804 to track how the patch file we are providing here
evolves over time.
