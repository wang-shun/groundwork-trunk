To minimize patch messages about patch hunks being applied at some
number of lines offset from where the patch file says they should go,
and thereby minimize the chance of a patch not being applied correctly,
the Nagios 3.2.3 patches should be applied in this order:

    patch -p0 -b < nagios-3.2.3-no_update_check.patch
    patch -p0 -b < nagios-3.2.3-mutex_check_result_fixes.patch
    patch -p0 -b < nagios-3.2.3-Makefile.in.statuswml2.patch
    patch -p0 -b < nagios-3.2.3-cgi-refresh.patch
    patch -p0 -b < nagios-3.2.3-circular-dependency-analysis.patch
    patch -p0 -b < nagios-3.2.3-extra-service-alerts.patch

The commands above are suitable for use in the parent directory of the
nagios-3.2.3/ directory where the Nagios source code has been untarred
(the -p0 option shown reflects this relative location).

In addition, the cgi/statuswml2.c file stored here should be placed in
the nagios-3.2.3/cgi/ directory before the build.

Note added May 10 2011:

These two patches:

    nagios-3.2.3-mutex_check_result_fixes.patch
    nagios-3.2.3-no_update_check.patch

will probably need some porting when we go to apply them to a future
Nagios release, because apparently the cgiutils.c and utils.c files
have been merged into a common file, common/shared.c, in the current
Nagios development tree.
