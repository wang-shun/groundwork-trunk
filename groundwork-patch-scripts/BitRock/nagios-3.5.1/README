Currently, I have no information about what patches are being applied
by BitRock to our Nagios 3.5.1 builds.  This issue is being tracked
as GWMON-11898.  I have some faint hope that they are applying all of
our Nagios 3.5.0 patches and that they all applied without any fuzz or
errors or missed patch hunks, but there has been no coordination to date
when we switched from Nagios 3.5.0 to Nagios 3.5.1 to ensure that any
of this has been handled appropriately.
