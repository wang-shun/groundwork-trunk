Notes on the Nagios 4.3.2 Release
================================================================

July 11, 2017

----------------------------------------------------------------

To build Nagios 4.3.2 here at GroundWork for development testing,
use the sibling Makefile.  It contains all the build instructions for
splaying out the upstream distribution, then patching, configuring,
compiling, and installing the software.  The installation process will
install header files in /usr/local/groundwork/common/include/nagios/
for use in building Bronx.

Here in this README, we describe issues that drive the build process
for both this Nagios release and our patches for it.

See the cousin README files for previous Nagios releases for more
information.  We are no longer carrying along some information which
is less directly relevant to the transition to a particular release.

----------------------------------------------------------------

Before we go deploying Nagios 4.3.2 in production, we should recognize
that it might contain certain known bugs.  Look here for a current list:

    https://github.com/NagiosEnterprises/nagioscore/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Abug

In particular, these issues might be of concern to GroundWork customers,
as listed on that page as of July 9, 2017:

    https://github.com/NagiosEnterprises/nagioscore/issues/386
	 segfault in nagios 4.3.2 (workers.c)
	 (it is recorded as part of the 4.3.3 milestone,
	 but we don't know when that release will appear)

    https://github.com/NagiosEnterprises/nagioscore/issues/384
	 Availability report is showing negative values
	 (it is recorded as part of the 4.3.3 milestone,
	 but we don't know when that release will appear)

    https://github.com/NagiosEnterprises/nagioscore/issues/87
	Implied inheritance for contacts/contact_groups does not work
	when service objects have contacts or contact_groups defined
	 (it is recorded as part of the 4.3.3 milestone,
	 but we don't know when that release will appear)

And here is a list of all current open issues:

    https://github.com/NagiosEnterprises/nagioscore/issues

That list includes these issues which might well be bugs but have not
yet been tagged as such:

    https://github.com/NagiosEnterprises/nagioscore/issues/23
	HOST max_check_attempts set to 1 goes SOFT and then HARD, extra
	check is performed

    https://github.com/NagiosEnterprises/nagioscore/issues/143
	status.cgi high CPU utilization in nagios-4.1.1

    https://github.com/NagiosEnterprises/nagioscore/issues/271
	Host count makes status.cgi use high cpu

    https://github.com/NagiosEnterprises/nagioscore/issues/311
	use_syslog doesn't seem to be working for me

which is not to say that this completely covers the waterfront for
the Nagios 4.3.2 release, since there may be some bugs that have been
addressed and closed but not yet incorporated into a public Nagios
release.

----------------------------------------------------------------

Separate Nagios-related package to be investigated in the future:

https://mod-gearman.org/

Note that there may be known issues with mod_gearman and Nagios 4.3.X;
that bears some investigating if we want to look in this direction.

https://github.com/sni/mod_gearman/issues/112

----------------------------------------------------------------

For generating future patches, note that we should always run the
nagios-X.X.X/indent-all.sh script (found within the Nagios release
itself) on our modified files before generating patch files.  This
presupposes that you have the "astyle" program installed on your machine
(http://astyle.sourceforge.net/).  This is the source-code formatter
used by the Nagios project, so we should follow their conventions in
case we want to submit any of our patches back to the project.

----------------------------------------------------------------

Whenever we need to patch Nagios, the status of all our patches for
a given release must be reflected in our GWiki "Nagios patches" page
(http://gwiki/index.php/Nagios_patches), in the section for that Nagios
release, in the order they should be applied.

----------------------------------------------------------------

The patches here have been developed against the Nagios 4.3.2 release.
They apply without any errors (fuzz, offsets, or outright rejection)
in the 4.3.2 release, in the following order:

    % cd nagios-4.3.2
    % patch -p1 -b < ../patches/nagios-4.3.2-host_check_cached_state.patch ...
    patching file base/checks.c
    % patch -p1 -b < ../patches/nagios-4.3.2-find_contact.patch ...
    patching file base/notifications.c
    % patch -p1 -b < ../patches/nagios-4.3.2-non_static_logging.patch
    patching file base/logging.c
    patching file include/logging.h
    % patch -p1 -b < ../patches/nagios-4.3.2-check_result_list.patch
    patching file include/config.h.in
    patching file include/objects.h
    patching file include/nagios.h
    patching file base/checks.c
    patching file base/utils.c
    % patch -p1 -b < ../patches/nagios-4.3.2-cgi_refresh.patch
    patching file cgi/extinfo.c
    patching file cgi/outages.c
    patching file cgi/status.c
    patching file cgi/statusmap.c
    patching file cgi/tac.c
    % patch -p1 -b < ../patches/nagios-4.3.2-Makefile.in.statuswml2.patch
    patching file cgi/Makefile.in
    % patch -p1 -b < ../patches/nagios-4.3.2-no_deprecation_warnings.patch
    patching file base/config.c
    patching file xdata/xodtemplate.c
    % patch -p1 -b < ../patches/nagios-4.3.2-groundwork_paths.patch
    patching file include/locations.h.in
    patching file configure
    patching file Makefile.in
    % patch -p1 -b < ../patches/nagios-4.3.2-traceroute_cgi_perl.patch
    patching file contrib/traceroute.cgi
    % patch -p1 -b < ../patches/nagios-4.3.2-no_update_check.patch
    patching file base/utils.c
    patching file include/defaults.h
    % patch -p1 -b < ../patches/nagios-4.3.2-no_nagios_php.patch
    patching file html/Makefile.in
    % patch -p1 -b < ../patches/nagios-4.3.2-no_tour.patch
    patching file cgi/extinfo.c
    patching file cgi/status.c
    patching file cgi/tac.c

We have ordered the patch-application sequence so any patches which we
could/should release publicly come first (although that is rare in the
patches we apply).  That way, they can be provided in unaltered form to
the upstream developers with line numbers that will reflect the virgin
files those developers will expect to start with.  It also makes it more
likely that our other patches will work with less alteration should our
patches be accepted upstream, when we can drop those particular patches.

Summarizing the above:  to eliminate patch messages about patch hunks being
applied at some number of lines offset from where the patch file says they
should go, and thereby minimize the chance of a patch not being applied
correctly, the Nagios 4.3.2 patches should be applied in this order:

    cd nagios-4.3.2
    patch -p1 -b < /path-to/nagios-4.3.2-host_check_cached_state.patch
    patch -p1 -b < /path-to/nagios-4.3.2-find_contact.patch
    patch -p1 -b < /path-to/nagios-4.3.2-non_static_logging.patch
    patch -p1 -b < /path-to/nagios-4.3.2-check_result_list.patch
    patch -p1 -b < /path-to/nagios-4.3.2-cgi_refresh.patch
    patch -p1 -b < /path-to/nagios-4.3.2-Makefile.in.statuswml2.patch
    patch -p1 -b < /path-to/nagios-4.3.2-no_deprecation_warnings.patch
    patch -p1 -b < /path-to/nagios-4.3.2-groundwork_paths.patch
    patch -p1 -b < /path-to/nagios-4.3.2-traceroute_cgi_perl.patch
    patch -p1 -b < /path-to/nagios-4.3.2-no_update_check.patch
    patch -p1 -b < /path-to/nagios-4.3.2-no_nagios_php.patch
    patch -p1 -b < /path-to/nagios-4.3.2-no_tour.patch

Here is an illustration of the commands one might use for testing.
This listing is just for expository purposes here.  In practice, it's
better to control patch application through the sibling Makefile.

    cd nagios-4.3.2
    patch -p1 -b < ../nagios-4.3.2-host_check_cached_state.patch ...
    patch -p1 -b < ../nagios-4.3.2-find_contact.patch
    patch -p1 -b < ../nagios-4.3.2-non_static_logging.patch
    patch -p1 -b < ../nagios-4.3.2-check_result_list.patch
    patch -p1 -b < ../nagios-4.3.2-cgi_refresh.patch
    patch -p1 -b < ../nagios-4.3.2-Makefile.in.statuswml2.patch
    patch -p1 -b < ../nagios-4.3.2-no_deprecation_warnings.patch
    patch -p1 -b < ../nagios-4.3.2-groundwork_paths.patch
    patch -p1 -b < ../nagios-4.3.2-traceroute_cgi_perl.patch
    patch -p1 -b < ../nagios-4.3.2-no_update_check.patch
    patch -p1 -b < ../nagios-4.3.2-no_nagios_php.patch
    patch -p1 -b < ../nagios-4.3.2-no_tour.patch

The commands above are suitable for use in the nagios-4.3.2/ directory
where the Nagios source code has been untarred (the -p1 option shown
reflects this location of the files to patch relative to the pathnames
in the patches).

Here's the current status of these patches:

    nagios-4.3.2-host_check_cached_state.patch
	This patch applies exactly.  It reflects a fix already made
	upstream for a release after Nagios 4.3.2, to stop using cached
	host state when it is not appropriate.	The need for GroundWork
	to apply this patch should disappear as of Nagios 4.3.3.  See the
	external references at the end of this README for more detail.

    nagios-4.3.2-find_contact.patch
	This patch applies exactly.  It corrects code to find a
	contact and thereby allows the $NOTIFICATIONAUTHORNAME$ and
	$NOTIFICATIONAUTHORALIAS$ macros to be properly expanded during
	an acknowledgement notification.  This patch is new with the
	Nagios 4.3.2 release, since we just recently tracked down the
	cause of the bug that it fixes, and reported this fix upstream.

    nagios-4.3.2-non_static_logging.patch
	This patch patch applies exactly.  It is directly applicable
	to this release, and is needed to support Bronx.  If at some
	point in the future Bronx is so significantly changed that it
	no longer operates within the Nagios main process, perhaps this
	patch can simply be dropped.

    nagios-4.3.2-check_result_list.patch
	This patch replaces nagios-3.5.0-mutex_check_result_fixes.patch
	that we applied to Nagios 3.5.1.  It is more comprehensive in
	the changes it makes to the Nagios code, having to pull in a
	bunch of code from Nagios 3.5.1 and modify it in certain ways
	to operate in the Nagios 4.3.2 context.

    nagios-4.3.2-cgi_refresh.patch
	This patch applies exactly.  It modifies Nagios CGI programs so
	they operate smoothly in the GroundWork context.

    nagios-4.3.2-Makefile.in.statuswml2.patch
	This patch applies exactly.  It requires the companion
	cgi/statuswml2.c program specific to this Nagios release.

    nagios-4.3.2-no_deprecation_warnings.patch
	This patch applies exactly.  It suppresses various deprecation
	warnings, including these which are visible in pre-flight results.
	The purpose is to not worry our customers about stuff which
	still works as-is and in any case will need to be handled by
	Monarch instead of customer action, to modify the actions taken
	to generate Nagios config files.

	Here are some example warning messages we are suppressing:

	    Warning: sleep_time is deprecated and will be removed.
	    Warning: command_check_interval is deprecated and will be removed. Commands are always handled on arrival
	    WARNING: Extinfo objects are deprecated and will be removed in future versions

	The following objects, configuration variables, and object
	attributes are now deprecated:

	    extinfo objects "hostextinfo" and "serviceextinfo" are still
	    supported in Nagios 4.3.2, but that support will disappear
	    in a future version; fold the attributes in these objects
	    into their respective parent host and service objects

	    auth_file                       (now just completely ignored)
	    command_check_interval          (now just completely ignored)
	    enable_embedded_perl            (now just completely ignored)
	    enable_failure_prediction       (now just completely ignored)
	    external_command_buffer_slots   (now just completely ignored)
	    p1_file                         (now just completely ignored)
	    sleep_time                      (now just completely ignored)
	    use_embedded_perl_implicitly    (now just completely ignored)

	    hourly_value    (still supported in Nagios 4.3.2, but that support
			    will disappear in a future version [probably 5.0.0];
			    use "importance" for this same value instead)
	    minimum_value   (still supported in Nagios 4.3.2, but that support
			    will disappear in a future version [probably 5.0.0];
			    use "minimum_importance" for this same value instead)

	The following config options are supposedly deprecated
	according to the What's New documentation, but not according
	to the code that processes these config options.  However, the
	What's New documentation is simply wrong, since we do still see
	EVENT_CHECK_REAPER events scheduled in the code for recurring
	execution.  (This controls reaping of files in the check
	result queue directory, but in the native Nagios 4.3.2 code,
	it no longer also looks for check results in an internal list.
	However, we have hijacked these events for our own purposes in
	processing all pending Bronx results in the main Nagios thread
	on a regular basis, in much the same way as happened in earlier
	Nagios releases.  We also reference the recovered data structure
	that is shared between Bronx and Nagios upon shutdown, to spill
	out any still-pending Bronx check results into a file, to have
	them picked up again upon Nagios restart so no internally-queued
	data is ever lost provided we don't have a hard crash.	It is
	these reaper events that will cause the saved data to be picked
	up and processed when Nagios starts up again.)

	    check_result_reaper_frequency
	    max_check_result_reaper_time

    nagios-4.3.2-groundwork_paths.patch
	This patch applies exactly.  It modifies varios build components
	to reflect certain pathnames as they apply in the GroundWork
	context, that are not otherwise set up correctly for us using
	./configure options.

    nagios-4.3.2-traceroute_cgi_perl.patch
	This patch applies exactly.  It converts contrib/traceroute.cgi
	to live in the GroundWork Monitor context.

    nagios-4.3.2-no_update_check.patch
	This patch applies exactly.  It has been updated from previous
	releases to reflect changes in the underlying code in the new
	Nagios release.  The present construction of this patch depends
	on the nagios-4.3.2-check_result_list.patch patch having been
	previously applied, to establish correct context for one hunk.

    nagios-4.3.2-no_nagios_php.patch
	This patch applies exactly.  It suppresses the installation of
	certain PHP files that we have no use for in the GroundWork
	context.  This avoids possible security holes in the queries
	that said PHP scripting performs, avoids the PHP code checking
	for upstream updates, and avoids certain advertising by the
	nagios.com site that makes no sense for GroundWork customers.

    nagios-4.3.2-no_tour.patch
	This patch applies exactly.  It suppresses links to embedded
	videos in several CGI pages.  Those videos are somewhat cheesy
	explanations of very limited depth about how to use certain
	Nagios CGI screens.  As a practical matter, the videos are
	mostly a marketing lure for Nagios Enterprises, so they don't
	make sense in the GroundWork context.

In addition to the patches described, the cgi/statuswml2.c file stored here
should be placed in the nagios-4.3.2/cgi/ directory before the build.
That placement is also handled by the sibling Makefile.

----------------------------------------------------------------

The top-level Nagios-distribution Makefile has a bug:  "make contrib"
believes that the "contrib" directory satisfies the make target by merely
existing, as opposed to causing a descent into the contrib directory
and building there.  The make target should probably be renamed to
"contribs", and named as such in the simple "make none" output.

Also, there should be an "install-contribs" target in the top-level
Makefile that installs the contribs stuff with "cd contrib; make install",
without needing to manually chdir to the contrib directory and run
"make install" there.

These issues have been reported upstream, so some future release might
improve the situation:

    https://support.nagios.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=34&t=44589

These issues have been worked around in the sibling Makefile.

----------------------------------------------------------------

There are a few new CGIs provided in this Nagios release, relative to
what GroundWork has seen before.  I haven't yet seen any documentation on
what these CGIs do, though I do have some evidence that they support the
Nagios PHP code (which we don't use) and perhaps some of the other CGIs.
Running them yields some limited information about what they're for.
Here we list only top-level queries; there are also a number of parameters
that can be applied to these queries.

Since they yield results in JSON instead of HTML, we should decide whether
access to these CGIs should be made available directly through Apache
and not just through the GroundWork Monitor UI (in support of other
CGIs), with some sort of appropriate authentication and authorization
controls applied.

----------------------------------------------------------------

The nagios/bin/worker-ping program is new with Nagios 4.2.4.  But it's
off in a subdirectory of the source code, as though it's only there
as a template for other workers.  (See the nagios-4.3.2/worker/ping/
directory.)  So we don't expect to see it in our build of Nagios 4.3.2 for
the GWMEE 7.2.0 release.  If we did include this program in the product,
we would want to take out the references to www.nagios.org from the
worker/ping/worker-ping.c code before compiling.

If this program were actually important to distribute, the top-level
Nagios-provided Makefile ought to have a "make install-workers" target
to descend into the worker/ directory and thence into the worker/ping/
directory and "make install" there.

----------------------------------------------------------------

If we were to provide Nagios 4.3.2 as a patch to GWMEE releases before
7.2.0, we would want to include our current updated copies of the
following files in the patch, outside of the 26 directories and 409 files
in the /usr/local/groundwork/nagios/ file tree (as of Nagios 4.3.1, at
least) that are being created by the "make install" target in our build
Makefile for the Nagios release itself.  (There will be some adjustments
to these numbers given that the BitRock build process sometimes splits
a compiled program into a wrapper and a separate hidden binary file.)

    /usr/local/groundwork/common/lib/libbronx.so
    /usr/local/groundwork/core/monarch/lib/MonarchForms.pm
    /usr/local/groundwork/core/monarch/lib/MonarchStorProc.pm

However, bear in mind that our MonarchStorProc.pm package has already
been updated to refer to the Monarch 4.6 release for GWMEE 7.2.0, and
that would need to be backed down to fit the target GWMEE release.

----------------------------------------------------------------

There are a number of Nagios configuration variables that are new with
the Nagios 4.3.2 release, and that Monarch in GWMEE 7.1.1 and previous
releases does not yet support.  Here are some of them:

    check_for_updates	(should we check for new Nagios releases?)
    bare_update_check	(report current version and new installs)
    query_socket	(path to and including the nagios.qh socket;
			in the GroundWork context, it should default to
			/usr/local/groundwork/nagios/var/spool/nagios.qh
			in correspondence with the command_file setting)

There are also some Nagios configuration variables that may have been
supported for a long time in older Nagios releases, but that we never
provided support for in Monarch.  Here are some of them:

    time_change_threshold   (This option determines when Nagios will
			    react to detected forward jumps in system
			    time.  If the system time jumps by this number
			    of seconds while Nagios is operating in its
			    main event loop, Nagios will make internal
			    adjustments to adapt to the sudden shift.
			    Normally, this is left undefined, which
			    means an internal default value is used.
			    [Make sure this variable works both with and
			    without a value defined in Monarch.])

For the GWMEE 7.2.0 release, we'll need to run a thorough scan to find all
such variables, and add them into Monarch configuration screens as needed.
(We may well just skip support for some of them.)  See this overview:

    https://assets.nagios.com/downloads/nagioscore/docs/nagioscore/4/en/whatsnew.html

Also see https://github.com/NagiosEnterprises/nagioscore/issues/213 and
http://tracker.nagios.org/view.php?id=0000607 for these undocumented
cgi.cfg options:

     New cgi.cfg options were added a while back to allow contactgroup
     names to authorize against the cgis. Documentation for these changes
     should be updated:

     authorized_contactgroup_for_all_hosts=
     authorized_contactgroup_for_all_services=
     authorized_contactgroup_for_system_information=
     authorized_contactgroup_for_configuration_information=
     authorized_contactgroup_for_all_host_commands=
     authorized_contactgroup_for_all_service_commands=
     authorized_contactgroup_for_system_commands=
     authorized_contactgroup_for_read_only= 

That might be an easier mechanism for certain customers to use than trying
to edit the individual CGI-access fields via some add-on post-Commit
scripting.

----------------------------------------------------------------

While testing our local build of Nagios 4.3.2, we get alerts of the
following form:

    [1484946999] SERVICE ALERT: localhost;local_process_nagios;CRITICAL;
	SOFT;1;NAGIOS CRITICAL: Could not locate a running Nagios process!

Such alerts are generated in our test setup because we're not running
a BitRock-compiled .nagios.bin program.  The command that generates the
service-check result is:

    $USER1$/check_nagios -F /usr/local/groundwork/nagios/var/status.log -e 5 -C bin/.nagios.bin

which is clearly looking for a .nagios.bin binary, not the "nagios"
binary that is produced by our local build of Nagios.  This should not
be a problem once we have BitRock provide the compiled program.

Nagios 4 changes from Nagios 3

By default, a Nagios 4 build replaces several of the CGI programs with
newer alternate versions that were not present in Nagios 3.  These new
versions cause difficulties in the GroundWork context, wherein we don't
generally support having scripting rooted directly at the base of our URL
namespace.  Until and unless we work out how to support these alternates,
via some combination of Nagios code changes and Apache httpd.conf changes,
we disable the alternates and revert back to using the original versions.
See the -DLEGACY_GRAPHICAL_CGIS setting in the Makefile for more detail.

Nagios 4.3.1 changes from Nagios 4.2.4

The upgraded version of Nagios includes a number of modifications that
are documented in the new distribution's Changelog file.  Here are the
issues that will most affect our use of the software.

Support for the nagios_check_command option for CGIs has been removed.
We haven't supported it in the Monarch UI since Nagios 1.x, so there's
no tragedy there.  However, in GWMEE 7.1.1, we are still emitting it
into our cgi.cfg file because we still have it in our monarch database.
This doesn't cause any problems with the Nagios 4.3.1 CGIs because they
simply ignore any options they're not looking for.  We can fully drop
support via the Monarch seed data and migration script in the GWMEE
7.2.0 release.

Support for a new tac_cgi_hard_only option for CGIs has been added.
Here's the description.
# SHOW ONLY HARD STATES IS TACTICAL OVERVIEW
# This option controls whether only HARD states are counted on the
# Tactical Overview, or if both HARD and SOFT states are counted.
# Set to 1 to show only HARD states. Defaults to 0 (HARD+SOFT).
We won't add this in a patch for GWMEE 7.1.1, since the CGIs work
without having this option defined, but we should add support for it in
GWMEE 7.2.0.

Nagios 4.3.X adds a few more deprecated-option notices (this time, for
normal_check_interval and retry_check_interval (or normal_retry_interval;
the deprecation code is confused on this point, as I have reported
upstream in https://support.nagios.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=34&t=42888),
which are now renamed to check_interval and retry_interval).  We'll need
to sweep through all deprecated options for the GWMEE 7.2.0 release and
rename the affected variables as the deprecation warnings recommend.
Also see if we support either a retry_check_interval or a retry_interval
for a host, as we do for a service.  (See what gets saved in the generated
nagios/etc/ files, not just what's in the Monarch UI and database.)

Nagios 4.3.2 changes from Nagios 4.3.1

(*) We added the nagios-4.3.2-host_check_cached_state.patch to this
    release, to fix a bug which has been fixed upstream for a later
    Nagios release.  External references for this fix:

    https://cases.groundworkopensource.com/browse/RSTUFF-167
    https://github.com/NagiosEnterprises/nagioscore/issues/372
    https://github.com/NagiosEnterprises/nagioscore/commit/887f9cd2943429384dccaf93aa7fd4b504e0bae5?diff=split

    The need for this patch should disappear when we upgrade to Nagios
    4.3.3 or later.

(*) We added the nagios-4.3.2-find_contact.patch to this release, to fix
    a bug found by Groundwork which has also now been reported upstream.

(*) Several other patches incorporate minor updates relative to what
    we used for the Nagios 4.3.1 release, to accommodate upstream code
    changes.
