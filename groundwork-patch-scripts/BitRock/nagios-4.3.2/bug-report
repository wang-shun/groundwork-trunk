[This has not yet been reported upstream, given that it's unclear whether
this fix has already been adopted.  It kind of looks like it has, but the
currently exposed Nagios full-file code does not reflect that.  This does
not actually affect the GroundWork build, because we comment out the calls
to logit() in our build.]

The following relates to the Nagio 4.3.2 code and its line numbering.

In the Nagios 4.3.2 release, an attempt was made to fix some
option-deprecation notices in the xdata/xodtemplate.c file, per the forum
report at https://support.nagios.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=34&t=42888 .

However, while the [icode]strcmp()[/icode] calls were changed, the warning text in the
accompanying [icode]logit()[/icode] calls was left as-is.  This means that the 4.3.2
code is now checking for [icode]retry_check_interval[/icode] and if found, warning
against the use of [icode]normal_retry_interval[/icode] instead.  This occurs in two
places in this file:

[code]
2400  else if(!strcmp(variable, "retry_interval") || !strcmp(variable, "retry_check_interval")) {
2401      if(!strcmp(variable, "retry_check_interval"))
2402          logit(NSLOG_CONFIG_WARNING, TRUE, "WARNING: The normal_retry_interval attribute is deprecated and will be removed in future versions. Please use retry_interval instead.\n");

2859  else if(!strcmp(variable, "retry_interval") || !strcmp(variable, "retry_check_interval")) {
2860      if(!strcmp(variable, "retry_check_interval"))
2861          logit(NSLOG_CONFIG_WARNING, TRUE, "WARNING: The normal_retry_interval attribute is deprecated and will be removed in future versions. Please use retry_interval instead.\n");
[/code]

The code currently exposed on github:

https://github.com/NagiosEnterprises/nagioscore/blob/master/xdata/xodtemplate.c

still contains these errors.  See
