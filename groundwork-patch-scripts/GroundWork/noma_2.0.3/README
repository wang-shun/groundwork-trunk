========================================================================
The stuff in this directory is here in service of GWMON-13009:
capture GWMEE-level NoMa patch-generation assets in Subversion.
========================================================================

If we revise NoMa patches, we do not pretend that we can reconstruct the
old TB patch files using this file tree.  That is not our purpose here.
We will update build files as necessary for the new versions of the NoMa
patches, and ensure that the new versions contain the desired content
and build correctly.  There are no guarantees of being able to build
older patches unless you check out a Subversion copy of this tree as it
existed when the original patches were built.

Makefile
    Automation for creating the final patches from the artifacts stored
    hereunder.  This is necessary to ensure that we don't make mistakes
    during iterative development and final construction of the NoMa
    patches, as there are many details to track and get right.  Type
    "make" with no arguments to create the TB tarballs to be published.

README
    The file you're now reading.

TB7.1.0-8.noma_fixes/
    Directory under which the final files for this particular patch are
    edited and deposited before final packaging as the patch tarball.
    In particular, the patch install and uninstall scripts live here,
    and are to be edited directly in this location.  In contrast, the
    tarball in this directory, containing the NoMa files that are fixed
    as part of the patch, is created by the top-level Makefile.

TB7.1.0-8.noma_fixes.tar.gz
    The built copy of the NoMa patch for the GWMEE 7.1.0 release, to be
    published as part of a public Technical Bulletin.

TB7.1.1-9.noma_fixes/
    Directory under which the final files for this particular patch are
    edited and deposited before final packaging as the patch tarball.
    In particular, the patch install and uninstall scripts live here,
    and are to be edited directly in this location.  In contrast, the
    tarball in this directory, containing the NoMa files that are fixed
    as part of the patch, is created by the top-level Makefile.

TB7.1.1-9.noma_fixes.tar.gz
    The built copy of the NoMa patch for the GWMEE 7.1.1 release, to be
    published as part of a public Technical Bulletin.

patch-7.1.0-perl/
    The files from the Perl JSON::PP package, as installed from CPAN
    over our GWMEE 7.1.0 release (which did not include this package).
    We installed and captured these files so we could include them in
    the tailored NoMa patch for the GWMEE 7.1.0 release, which differs
    slightly from the patch for the GWMEE 7.1.1 release in that it has
    to include some stuff that was later fixed and folded into GWMEE
    7.1.1 before that release went out.

    We identified the particular added files by saving away a copy of
    the full GWMEE 7.1.0 perl tree, adding the JSON::PP package using
    perl/bin/cpan, and then running a full-tree diff.  Note that the
    global perl/lib/5.8.9/x86_64-linux-thread-multi/.packlist file, while
    it is modified by adding the JSON::PP package, is not included in
    our NoMa patch.  That's because doing so might overlay and wipe out
    information about packages the site has locally installed.  We lose
    information that the JSON::PP package is installed, but that is not
    critical to operation of the system.

patch-7.1.1-9-page
    Initial text for the indicated TB.  It's easier to edit this content
    first as a standalone file in this manner before publishing to the KB.
    The actual page content evolves further once it's in the KB.

patch-7.1.1-perl/
patch-7.2.0-perl/
    The files from the Perl JSON::PP package, as included in the GWMEE
    7.1.1 and GWMEE 7.2.0 builds, respectively.  We captured these files
    during patch development so we could compare them against what
    we need to include for the tailored NoMa patch for GWMEE 7.1.0.
    These files are not actually included in our NoMa patch for the
    GWMEE 7.1.1 release.

patch-noma/
    A file tree containing all of the most up-to-date patched NoMa files,
    that might appear in any or all of the NoMa patches.  The build of
    each patch extracts from this tree only the particular NoMa files
    that it needs.  The particular files we included in this tree are
    constructed elsewhere based on our patched official NoMa build,
    and copied here manually.

update_foundation
    An original script for testing just the part of the patch
    installation that adds the fas.executor.interrupt property to the
    config/foundation.properties file.  The code in this script has been
    folded into the patch install scripts, and possibly improved there,
    so this standalone script remains only for historical interest.
