This directory contains certain key database-related dumps that are
useful either in creating NoMa patches or in testing NoMa distributions,
upgrades, and patches.

noma-db.sql

    This is a copy of the schema for the "noma" database, as shipped in a
    GWMEE release.  The official copy is stored elsewhere in Subversion.
    This copy is here only to simplify the process of constructing NoMa
    patches, and must be kept up-to-date with the main copy when new
    patches are to be produced.

noma-entire.sao.2017-08-30_12.52.10.sql.bz2

    This is a complete dump of a "noma" database, collected from running
    tests of a GroundWork system at fairly high volume over a period
    of many months.  It represents the best, most complicated database
    we have for testing of NoMa and especially our data-conversion
    scripting in patches.  The data it includes was collected before our
    omnibus NoMa patches were in play, so before it is ready for use with
    recent NoMa code in GWMEE 7.2.0 builds, it must be converted using
    our pg_migrate_noma.pl script.  In that sense, it does serve as an
    excellent testbed for the scripting involved in the pg_migrate_noma.pl
    processing, especially the switch_noma_to_generated_ids.sql script.

    This file was compressed with bzip2 to best reduce its size for
    storage in Subversion.  It may be uncompressed with bunzip2.  To load
    it into the database:

	bunzip2 noma-entire.sao.2017-08-30_12.52.10.sql.bz2
	service groundwork stop noma
	psql noma < noma-entire.sao.2017-08-30_12.52.10.sql

    To test the operation of the switch_noma_to_generated_ids.sql script
    specifically, thereafter:

	psql noma < switch_noma_to_generated_ids.sql

    (Note that the switch_noma_to_generated_ids.sql script can be run
    multiple times without reloading the database.  The first run on this
    test database will convert lots of unique-iD values, and later runs
    will shuffle around some of the leftover data but still be safe for
    continued operation afterward.)
