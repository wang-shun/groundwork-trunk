2. Preface
===========

NoMa, which stands for "Notification Manager", is an easily extensible
tool to simplify the management of Nagios notifications.

NoMa consists of a web frontend for managing notifications and contacts
and viewing logs, etc. and a notifier script, which takes notifications
from Nagios to process them as defined via the NoMa frontend.

NoMa was sponsored by DeLaval.




3. Installation
================

3.1 Preparation
----------------

To install Noma, you need the following software working properly:

* a http server
* PHP5
* SQLite (default) or MySQL (optional)

Download the current NoMa-release from monitoringexchange.org or
sourceforge.net and unpack it in a www path of your choice.

NoMa was originally designed to integrate with Nagios, but has been
successfully coupled with other monitoring systems.
For best results you should use the following:


* Nagios with NDO
* Icinga with IDO

3.2 Setting up the database
----------------------------

This is only needed if you decide to use MySQL - the SQLite database will be
automatically created the first time the daemon starts if it does not exist.

NOTE: To set up the database you might need administration rights.

1. Create the NoMa database:
   $ mysqladmin -u root -p create noma

2. Login to the database and grant access rights:
   NOTE: replace the very secret_password by your own one!
   > mysql -u root -p noma
   > grant select, insert, update, delete to noma_user identified by 'secret_password';

3. import the NoMa database by using the file 'myqsl_new_install.sql' located
   in your extracted archive's sub directory 'sql/mysql':
   $ mysql -u root -p noma < mysql_new_install.sql


3.3 Installing the daemon
----------------------------

NoMa requires a daemon to be running.  Sample start scripts for Debian and Redhat
are available in the notifier directory.  Note that you may have to alter
paths and user variables in the script to match your system.

For Debian:

* cp /path_to_noma/notifier/noma_initscript.debian /etc/init.d/noma
* update-rc.d noma defaults
* /etc/init.d/noma start

3.4 Apache configuration
----------------------------

Copy the example /path_to_noma/etc/apache2-noma.conf to your local apache2/conf.d directory, like /etc/apache2/conf.d/
Modify it to fit your needs and restart apache afterwards to load the new configuration.
See the sample file for examples of configuration.


4. Configuration
=================

Starting with Version 2.0.2 there is a single configuration file for both
the frontend and backend.  You will need to install the YAML::Syck module
for perl and the yaml extension for php (e.g. with pear install yaml).

Change settings in your 'NoMa.yaml', located in the directory
'etc', replacing all occurrences of "nagios" with "icinga" if using the latter.

4.1 Configuring the frontend
-----------------------------

4.1.1 frontend
---------------

1. Setting the frontend language:
   The language is set via the variable 'language'. Valid parameters
   are 'en' and 'de'.

2. authentication_type - setting up authentication

   User data is stored in the table 'contacts'.
   NoMa can be used without any authentication but also supports
   the following authentication methods:

   * 'native'   -   store your passwords in the internal NoMa database

                    Usernames and passwords are stored in the table 'contacts'.
                    Passwords are encrypted using SHA1.

   * 'http'     -   authenticate via http auth

                    Set up your http server to use http authentication and
                    add your users without passwords in the contacts table.

                    If your usernames are passed as user@DOMAIN.NAME (like when you
                    are using kerberos tickets) you have to set
                    'username_is_email' in 'http' to true.

                    'check_local_user' in 'http' has to be set to true if
                    you are using the same users for multiple frontends
                    such as Nagios and NoMa. Otherwise a user can login
                    to Nagios and can bypass the NoMa login afterwards.
                    'check_local_user' checks the database for every user
                    who tries to access NoMa.

   * 'ldap'     -   authenticate via ldap

                    Set up your ldap server to use ldap authentication and
                    add your users without passwords in the contacts table.

                    NoMa has to be configured correctly to work with
                    ldap authentication. These settings are done via the
                    array 'ldap' in your configuration file.

3. Setting up the notification manager (add/edit/delete)
   Notification management is set up via 'notifications':

   * 'add_owner'      - automatically add the person, who is owner of a
                        notification, when submitting a new notification
                        or a notification update

   * 'host_service_preview'
                      - enable host and service preview when entering include-/
                        exclude hosts and services
                        this option requires NDO access to be set up in the 
                        'api' section (see below)

   * 'preview_width'  - width (in pixels) of preview area (default: 250)

   * 'preview_max_length'
                      - maximum length of preview output (0 for infinite)
                        if the output exceeds this value, it will be trimmed and
                        '...' will be appended

   * 'preview_scroll' - enable/disable scrolling for host and service preview
                        (true/false)

   * 'preview_max_height'
                      - maximum height (in pixels) of preview area when
            scrolling is enabled


4. Setting up the contactgroup manager
   The contactgroup manager is set up via 'contactgroups':

   * 'admin_only'     -    set this to true to grant access to the contactgroup
                           manager to admins only

5. Setting up the log viewer:
   Log viewing is set up via 'logs':

   * 'admin_only'      -   set this to true to grant viewing logs to admin
                           users only

   * 'pages_per_line'  -   define the maximum of displayed pages for the
                           page navigation ('1 2 3 ... > >>') of the
                           log viewer

   * 'num_results'     -   define the drop down box of the log viewer enabling
                           the users to select the number of results per page

6. Setting up the overview page:
   Set 'overview' to trim large columns on the overview page.

   * 'overview_host'     -   maximum length of host definitions
                             (minus 3 for '...')

   * 'overview_service'  -   maximum length for service definitions
                             (minus 3 for '...')

7. Setting up the status page:
   Viewing is set up via 'statuspage':

   * 'admin_only'      -   set this to true to grant viewing the status page to
               admin users only

8. Setting up the timeframe page:
   Viewing is set up via 'timeframes':

   * 'admin_only'      -   set this to true to grant viewing and editing the 
                           timeframes page to admin users only

4.1.2 db - the database setup
------------------------------

This section is valid for both the frontend and the backend.

Choosing the backend: NoMa currently supports using SQLite3 or MySQL
   as backends to be used in conjunction with its daemon. MySQL is 
   recommended for large installations with thousands of notifications on
   a daily basis. There might be special considerations to leaverage when
   choosing SQLite3 as backend:
   - No remote connections from outside the server directly to DB.
   - Speed is determined by disk I/O on how fast it can commit to disk.
   - No easy way to maintain the DB while its running.

Setting the database connection:
   Set type to the chosen backend, either 'mysql' or 'sqlite3'.

   Credentials if MySQL:
   Database credentials are set via the array 'mysql'.
   Please define your database host, user, password and the name of your
   database here. You can also set 'persistent' to '1' to enable
   persistent connections.

   "Credentials" if SQLite3:
   This does NOT use credentials and access is controlled via user/group
   permissions to the database and its parent folder.
   The installation script should do the right thing, and create the var/
   directory as group-writeable for the webserver.
   Normal fileowner/filegroup/filerights on the database would be:
   - user:   nagios, alternatively icinga, depending on what source is.
   - group:  wwwrun, alternatively  apache or whatever your webserver uses.
   - chmod 660 (rw / rw / -)



4.1.3 api - previews
---------------------

Setting up NDO access for host and service previews
   NDO-database credentials are set via the array 'api'.
   Please define your database host, user, password and the name of your
   database here. You can also set 'persistent' to '1' to enable
   persistent connections.
   Additionally, you need to define your NDO-table prefix via 'table_prefix'
   which is usually 'nagios_'.


4.2 Configuring the notifier
-----------------------------

The notifier has to be configured to access the database.
Change settings in your 'NoMa.yaml', located in the directory
'etc'. 

The notifier's configuration parameters are described below.

4.2.1 db - the database setup for the notifier
-----------------------------------------------

(see also 4.1.2)

type                  - the dbtype to use, either 'mysql' or 'sqlite3'
automatic_db_upgrade  - currently only supported when using SQLite3, to setup
                        the standard database on startup of the daemon if it's
                        unable to find any content.

if MySQL:
mysql:
 host:        - the database host; example: 'localhost'
 database:    - the database name; example: 'noma'
 user:        - the database user; example: 'noma_user'
 password:    - the database password; example 'noma_secret'

if SQLite3:
dbfile:  - the path to the database file.

4.2.3 log - the logging setup for the notifier
-----------------------------------------------

pluginOutput        - log plugin output (0 = disabled | 1 = enabled)
hostServiceOutput   - log host- and service output (0 = disabled | 1 = enabled)
delimiter           - delimiter to separate logging strings; example: ' | '


4.2.4 path - the path setup for the notifier
---------------------------------------------

cache           - not used
pidfile         - stores the PID of the running process


4.2.5 input - the input methods for the notifier
-------------------------------------------------

pipeEnabled     - enables the pipe method
pipePath        - the pipe itself
socketEnabled       - enables unix sockets
socketAddress       - address of the socket. N.B. there is no security -
              do not allow access to non-trusted networks
socketPort      - TCP port to listen on
socketMaxConns      - how many connections to spawn (max. simultaneous connects)


4.2.6 command - the command methods for the notifier
-----------------------------------------------------

These provide a mapping between the database and the actual notification commands.  Ensure that
the scripts exist and are executable for the nagios user.


4.2.7 notifier - attempts and retries for the notifier
-------------------------------------------------------

Most notifier commands always return success.  The big exception is voicecall, which returns
success only if a call has been confirmed by the user with a keypress (can be overridden with
the field ack_able in the notification_methods table).

maxAttempts     - how often we try a notification before giving up
timeToWait      - how many seconds to wait before retries
delay           - delay notifications this number of seconds (for bundling)
bundle          - set to 1 to bundle multiple voice alerts into a single notification
ackPipe         - on receipt of an acknowledgement, this file will be written to using
              the standard Nagios command format.


4.2.7.1 bundling

        Voice alerts can quickly become unuseable if many are generated in a short space of time.
        With "bundling" is is possible to combine multiple alerts in one message, and acknowledge
        them all in one go.

        An incoming alert will be delayed by "delay" seconds in the queue.  After this time has
        been reached, ALL voice alerts for a contact will be combined into a bundled message.
        If the recipient fails to confirm the message, the alerts will then be separated again
        and the bundling process begins again after the oldest alert has reached timeToWait.


4.2.8 escalator - the internal escalator
-----------------------------------------

NoMa normally reacts to external alerts, and its rules are matched based on the number of alerts
received.  However some alerts only occur once but still need to be escalated.

The internal escalator generates "fake alerts" which simulate incoming alerts.

internalEscalation  - a global flag that causes all rules to escalate internally.  Setting
              this to 0 will enable per rule settings ("let notifier handle")
timeToWait      - wait this number of seconds before escalating to the next rule
stopAfter       - stop escalating after this number of seconds

Note that alerts which are never cleared with an OK will continue escalating until the "stopAfter"
limit is reached and will stay in the escalation_stati table until they are deleted - you can
see this in the Status page (the alerts with ESC xxx, where xxx represents the number of times
that the alert was escalated)



4.2.9 notification configuration
---------------------------------

The individual notifications are configured in this section

4.2.9.1 voicecall

        Voice alerts are generated with an Asterisk (or Starface) soft PBX.
        See 4.4.3 for further info

4.2.9.2 sendsms

        SMS alerts are sent via an attached SMS-capable modem using smstool3
        or an iSMS/SMSFinder hardware device.
        See 4.4.2 for further info

4.2.9.3 sendemail

        Emails are sent using the standard system mailer - you may need
        to configure your mail relay to accept mails from the system.
        See 4.4.1 for further info

4.2.9.4 growl

	Growl notifications are sent using an included script. It requires the Perl module
	Net::Growl and by standard it uses UDP 9887 by default.

	Server only requires Perl module Net::Growl as stated earlier.

	Client, depending on OS, requires an extra client:
	- Mac: http://growl.info
	- Linux: http://mattn.github.com/growl-for-linux/
        - Windows: http://www.growlforwindows.com/gfw

        After install, allow notifications from network, optional require password from LAN.


4.2.10 debug - debugging for the notifier
------------------------------------------

These provide various debugging and logging features.
The watchdog restarts the daemon if too much memory is used - be careful not to set
this too low, because pending retries will be lost on a restart.

logging         - enables general debugging (4 settings, 0 = off, 1 = little, 2 = more, 3 = debug)
queries         - log (most) SQL queries
file            - the file to log to (if unset will log to stdout)
paramlog        - enable parameter logging
voice           - enable logging of voice alert errors
sms         - enable logging of sms alert errors
daemonize       - forks the notifier into the background (0 = disabled | 1 = enabled)
watchdogEnabled     - start the watchdog thread (0 = disabled | 1 = enabled)
watchdogMaxRSS      - restart if the used memory exceeds this value
watchdogMaxVSS      - restart if total memory (including swapped out) exceeds this value
watchdogMaxRuntime  - restart after this many seconds

4.3 Configuring Nagios to use NoMa
-----------------------------------

To tell Nagios about the new notification methods, you have to add them
to your misccommands.cfg or wherever you want to:

define command{
        command_name    host-notify-by-noma
        command_line    /path_to_noma/alert_via_noma.pl -c h -s "$HOSTSTATE$" -H "$HOSTNAME$" -G "$HOSTGROUPNAMES$" -n "$NOTIFICATIONTYPE$" -i "$HOSTADDRESS$" -o "$HOSTOUTPUT$" -t "$TIMET$" -u "$$(( $HOSTPROBLEMID$ ? $HOSTPROBLEMID$ : $LASTHOSTPROBLEMID$ ))" -A "$NOTIFICATIONAUTHORALIAS$" -C "$NOTIFICATIONCOMMENT$" -R "$NOTIFICATIONRECIPIENTS$"
        }

define command{
        command_name    service-notify-by-noma
        command_line    /path_to_noma/alert_via_noma.pl -c s -s "$SERVICESTATE$" -H "$HOSTNAME$" -G "$HOSTGROUPNAMES$" -E "$SERVICEGROUPNAMES$" -S "$SERVICEDESC$" -o "$SERVICEOUTPUT$" -n "$NOTIFICATIONTYPE$" -a "$HOSTALIAS$" -i "$HOSTADDRESS$" -t "$TIMET$" -u "$$(( $SERVICEPROBLEMID$ ? $SERVICEPROBLEMID$ : $LASTSERVICEPROBLEMID$ ))" -A "$NOTIFICATIONAUTHORALIAS$" -C "$NOTIFICATIONCOMMENT$" -R "$NOTIFICATIONRECIPIENTS$"
        }

With the option -p you can force the plugin to use the pipe instead of the unix socket.

You can also pass a unique ID with option -u.  However you generate this value, it must be
stable across consecutive non-UP/OK states for a given host or service in order for the
NoMa internal notification-counting logic to clock correctly.  For that purpose, for Nagios
notifications, this is done by using the $HOSTPROBLEMID$ and $SERVICEPROBLEMID$ macros.  If
you do not specify a -u option, either the alert_via_noma.pl script or NoMa itself will
generate one for you, but the standard value so created will be semi-random, not stable
across consecutive non-UP/OK states.  So it will not clock the NoMa notification-counting
logic correctly.  If you want NoMa to gnenerate unique IDs that will work across all alerting
agents and that will clock the NoMa notification-counting logic correctly, you must set the
"generate_IDs" option in the "notifier" section of NoMa.yaml to a true value such as 1.  In
that case, all the incoming -u option values will be ignored, and NoMa will use its own
internal resources to construct unique IDs for stretches of non-UP/OK states of hosts and
services.


Now change your contact definitions (maybe in contact.cfg) to use NoMa:

define contact {
        ...
        service_notification_commands   service-notify-by-noma
        host_notification_commands      host-notify-by-noma
        ...
        }

4.4 Configuring the individual notifiers
-----------------------------------------

The various notifier scripts are configured in NoMa.yaml and need to be installed.


4.4.1 sendEmail.pl
-------------------

The email text can be customized in NoMa.yaml

This notifier provides the following options:

sendmail        - the mail sending binary

Host and service message texts can be individually configured:

subject         - the subject line of the mail
message         - the message body in utf-8 format
filename        - the contents of this file will be read into the variable file

The parameters above can contain the following variables:
$host           - name of the host generating an alarm
$service        - name of the service on the host
$file           - the contents of the file specified in "filename"
$host_address       - host address as passed to NoMa
$host_alias     - host alias as passed to NoMa
$hostgroups     - (all) hostgroups passed to NoMa
$servicegroups  - (all) servicegroups passed to NoMa
$status         - status (WARNING/CRITICAL/OK/UNKNOWN/UNREACHABLE)
$datetimes      - alert time in unix time format
$datetime       - alert time converted to local time
$output         - text output of the alert
$notification_type  - type (PROBLEM/RECOVERY)
$from           - mail sender
$to         - mail recipient

4.4.2 sendSMS.pl
-----------------

This requires sendsms from smstools3 to be installed in /usr/local/bin


4.4.3 sendVoice.pl
-------------------

This calls the script voicecall.pl

If you have a Starface PBX then set the "starface" option to 1 - you will also need
the starface Module to be installed (not supplied in this archive)

The script requires access to the manager interface of Asterisk to create an outgoing voicecall.
See the help text inside the script for further configuration details

In a similar way to the options for sendemail, the following are supported:

return_ack      - feeds acknowledgements back to Nagios or Icinga (the Asterisk normally
              takes care of this, but bundled alerts have to be handled by NoMa)
suppression     - a value in minutes - if NoMa receives the suppression command in the
              format SUPPRESSION;method;name_to_log it will suppress any alerts for
              the method for this number of minutes.  Typically this is used to prevent
              excessive numbers of voicecalls/smses (e.g. the Asterisk/Starface could
              be configured to send SUPPRESSION;voicecall;username)
server          - the PBX (if an array is given then it will try the servers sequentially
callerID        - outgoing callerid (usually 0 uses the default)
channel         - the outgoing channel (varies depending on the hardware)
international_prefix    - what to replace a + sign with in numbers
suffix          - a channel suffix if required
bundled_message     - the message to use for bundled alerts. The variable $count is the number of
              alerts in the bundle.  N.B. a bundled alert is treated like a host alert
message         - the texts to be spoken by the Text-to-Speech engine.  "header" is always
              read out at the beginning of the message.  Variable substitution is similar
              to that for sendEmail.pl


5. The Frontend
================

Authentication is set to 'native' by default.  You can login as 'nagiosadmin'
by using the password 'nagiosadmin'.

5.1 Managing contacts

5.1.1 Adding contacts
      If you are using authentication, only admins are allowed to add
      contacts. Adding of contacts is done via the 'Contacts'
      link at the overview page.

5.1.2 Modifying contacts
      If you are using authentication, every user can edit his own
      profile, only. Non-admin users can do this via the 'Profile'
      link at the overview page.
      Users who want to manage their holidays, can do this here.

5.1.3 Deleting contacts
      Only admins (if authentication is used) can delete contacts.
      Just select a user on the 'Contacts' page and submit
      by using 'Delete user'.

      If a user is deleted, all his data will be lost. Notifications
      owned by that user will be disabled and given to the user '[---]'.
      Notifications owned by this user cannot be enabled until assigned
      to an existing user!


5.2 Managing contactgroups
---------------------------

5.2.1 Adding contactgroups
      Contactsgroups can be added if 'create new' is selected in the
      group selector of 'Contactgroups'. Simply type in the short name
      and the name of the new contactgroup and hit the submit button.
      If the group has the option "Do not send notifications to members"
      set then it is a view-only group.

5.2.2 Modifying contactgroups
      Contactgroups can be edited by selecting them in the upper
      area of the contactgroup manager.

      After selection, contactgroup data will appear. Here you can
      change the short name, the name and the members of the selected
      contactgroup.

      After hitting the edit area's submit button, the selected
      contactgroup will be updated.

5.2.3 Deleting contactgroups
      You can delete contactgroups by selecting them in the upper
      area of the contactgroup manager. Now hit the 'delete' button,
      which is right of the select box.


5.3 Managing notifications
---------------------------

Be aware that active notifications that are being processed by NoMa
may not take account of changes made after they are started.

5.3.1 Adding notifications
      Simply click on 'Notification' in your main navigation and define
      your notification.

      Hosts and Services are supposed to be comma-separated lists.
      You can use the wildcards '*' and '?' to ease the definition of
      multiple hosts with similar names.  The names are case-insensitive.

      Includes are parsed before excludes, and any include left blank
      will be assumed to match all (i.e. an implicit '*').



      Define the time of notification via the field labeled with
      'Notify after' by a semicolon-separated list of numbers
      and intervals.
      Examples:
      1;2;4-6          The assigned contact(s) will be notified when
                       the first notification from Nagios is passed
                       to the notifier and also after two, four,
                       five and six notifications.
      1;3;4;8          The assigned contact(s) will be notified one,
                       three, four and eight times after the initial
                       notification.

      It is important to note that the counter increases by 1 each time
      the daemon receives a notification from Nagios.  You should configure
      your nagios to resend notifications regularly and make use of the
      interval.

      Enabling "Let notifier handle escalations" will cause NoMa to simulate
      the reception of notifications from Nagios and is useful for one-off
      alerts.  It can be stopped by an OK alert, or when the "stopAfter"
      limit is reached (see 4.2.8).

      Enabling rollover causes NoMa to start again at number 1 when the last
      notification has been reached.

      New notifications are never active! You have to activate them
      via the small 'X' button on the left side of your notification's
      row (overview).


5.3.2 Modifying notifications
      To modify a notification, click the little pen symbol left, on the
      notification's row (overview).

      In the modify dialogue, you also can configure contact escalations.
      Simply hit the 'Add escalation' button and define your escalation
      after a defined number of notifications.
      If you want to remove an escalation, simply hit the corresponding
      'Remove escalation' button.

5.3.3 Deleting notifications
      Deletion of notifications is done via the small trash icon, on
      the left side of the notification's row (overview).

5.3.4 Filtering of notification rules
      Notifications will be sent, based on the filters you configure. 
      Based on include and exclude rules defined in the database 
      (populated through the webfrontend), notifications are sent to 
      users and/or groups of users. 

      Starting with version 2.0.2, the logic has been altered to more closely
      mirror expectations.  It should be noted that any "include" fields that are
      empty are assigned an implicit '*', i.e. they automatically match all
      possibilities.  The filter logic for a service is defined as follows;

      recipients is empty OR
        (
          at least one of the recipients matches the "Include recipients" pattern
          AND
          none of the recipients match the "Exclude recipients" pattern
        )
      AND
      servicegroups is empty OR
        (
          at least one of the servicegroups matches the "Include servicegroups" pattern
          AND
          none of the servicegroups match the "Exclude servicegroups" pattern
        )
      AND
      hostgroups is empty OR
        (
          at least one of the hostgroups matches the "Include hostgroups" pattern
          AND
          none of the hostgroups match the "Exclude hostgroups" pattern
        )
      AND
        (
          the host matches the "Include hosts" pattern list
          AND
          the host doesn't match the "Exclude hosts" pattern list
        )
      AND
        (
          the servicedesc matches the "Include services" pattern list
          AND
          the servicedesc doesn't match the "Exclude services" pattern list
        )

      Host checks use the same filter logic but ignore the service / servicegroup fields.

      Below is an example illustrating how the filters now work.

      Example notification:
      - Host 1
        * name: mysql-lnxsrv01
        * member of hostgroups: mysql, linux-servers
        * service(desc): MySQL Service
        * servicegroups: mysql-svcs

      - Host 2
        * name: mysql-lnxsrv02
        * member of hostgroups: mysql, linux-servers
        * service(desc): MySQL Query Cache Hitrate
        * servicegroups: mysql-svcs

      - Filters:
        * Hostgroup Include: mysql
        * Servicegroup Include: mysql-svcs
        * Service Exclude: mysql query*

      - Result Host 1:
        1. Matches include for servicegroup
        2. Matches include for hostgroup
        3. Rule matches, notification sent.

      - Result Host 2:
        1. Matches include for servicegroup
        2. Matches include for hostgroup
        3. Matches exclude for service
        4. Rule does not match, notification not sent to members of this
      notification rule.

      Based on this logic, we believe that you can make quite flexible, 
      yet strong rules for handling your notifications.

5.3.5 Filtering by notification type
      Alerts can be restricted to react to particular types of problem (e.g. Warning, Unknown)
      using the "Filter on" field of the method.  It is not possible to mix problem types within
      a single rule.

      Starting with version 2.0.3 it is possible to also filter on transitions.  These will activate
      every time the transition occurs and are very useful for notifying worsening problems.o

      Example Rules:
      - Rule 1
        * Notify after: 1-3
        * Filter on: Warning
        * Notify by: E-Mail

      - Rule 2
        * Notify after: 1
        * Filter on: Warning to critical
        * Rollover: enabled
        * Notify by: SMS

      - Notifications:
        1. WARNING
        2. WARNING
        3. WARNING
        4. WARNING
        5. WARNING
        6. CRITICAL
        7-99. CRITICAL
      - Result:
        Notifications 1-3 will generate an email.
        Notification 6 will generate an SMS.
        No further alerts will be generated.
      


5.4 Viewing logs
-----------------

The log viewer can be accessed via the link 'View logs' at the overview
page.

On the log viewer's page you can set a filter via 'Find', set the number
of rows per page and browse through your notification logs.

Handling is very simple.


5.5 Status page
----------------

The status page shows notifications currently being executed (you are only
likely to see active voice calls here because the other methods are much
quicker to execute). The status ACTIVE x signifies a notification has reached
retry number x, the status ESC x signifies an escalation has reached number x.

If the page contains various entries with ESC 17 this signifies escalations
that were never acknowledged and reached the "stopAfter" limit - i.e. 90mins / 300
seconds = 18 notifications = 17 escalations.

6. Extending the notifier
==========================

6.1 Coding of notification plugins
-----------------------------------

To code a notification plugin, you only have to mind, that the following
(mostly Nagios-generated data) is passed in the following order:

 1. <FROM>               - the 'from' field is defined in the database
                           table 'notification_methods', column 'from'

 2. <TO>                 - the 'to' field is the data contained in the
                           column of your contact's information defined
                           by 'contact_field' in the table
                           'notification_methods'

 3. <CHECK-TYPE>         - the check type is either 'h' for host or 's'
                           for service checks

 4. <DATETIME>           - this parameter contains date and time, as passed
                           on by Nagios

 5. <STATUS>             - the result of the check
                           Hostchecks: UP, UNREACHABLE, DOWN
                           Servicechecks: OK, WARNING, CRITICAL, UNKNOWN

 6. <NOTIFICATION-TYPE>  - the notification type as passed on by Nagios

 7. <HOST-NAME>          - the host name as passed on by Nagios

 8. <HOST-ALIAS>         - the host's alias as passed on by Nagios

 9. <HOST-IP>            - the host's ip address as passed on by Nagios

10. <INCIDENT ID>        - incident id, either from Icinga/Nagios or 
			   internally generated by NoMa.

11. <AUTHOR>		 - author of notification, like 
			   acknowledgements or custom notifications.

12. <COMMENT>		 - the comment in a custom notification or
			   acknowledgement.

13. <OUTPUT>             - HOSTOUTPUT or SERVICEOUTPUT, depending on the
                           check type, as passed on by Nagios

14. [SERVICE]            - the service description as passed on by Nagios
                           (only if check type is 's')


Just let your plugin create messages out of these parameters and pass
the generated messages to the sending application.
Give back the return code of that application to the notifier.

You can have a look at the example 'sendVoice.pl'.



6.2 Embedding of notification plugins into the application
-----------------------------------------------------------

To make the notifier use your plugin, simply add a row to the table
'notification_methods' and define method (as it should be displayed
in the frontend), command (the name of your plugin as configured in
NoMa.yaml), the column name of the table 'contacts' where the
recipient's data is stored and the sender (e.g. an E-Mail address
for the 'From:' info).  The on_fail field specifies which method will
come next if a plugins returns an error.  This is currently only
used by the voicecall plugin, to provide fallback to SMS or Email.

The ack_able field signifies a method that returns exit code 0 if
the problem can be acknowledged, and exit code 1 if it should not be.
Any method that is configured as ack_able will cause the escalation
chain to end if it returns exit code 0 (typically only voice should
use this method as email/sms provide no guarantee that a message has
been received and understood).


6.3 Language files
-------------------

To enable as many users as possible to use NoMa, you are encouraged to
send us language files! :)

Just take a file out of the sub directory 'lang', copy it and substitute
the data by an other language. Thanks!


7. Advanced Features 
=====================

7.1 Timezone support
---------------------

NoMa makes use of the perl DateTime::TimeZone to provide proper timezone support
(including winter / summer time) for contacts.

The zone is set at the contact level and simplifies worldwide support for
working hours.

NOTE: the timezone (+?h) displayed in the webinterface is only indicative of
the time difference assuming no daylight saving time, however the perl library
will ensure correct handling of the time zones.

Also be aware that daylight saving for various regions of the world changes
occasionally (e.g.  Western Australia) and you will need to ensure that your
DateTime::TimeZone module is current if you have contacts in one of these zones.


7.2 Debugging
--------------

NoMa provides comprehensive debugging support.  Notification errors are logged
into the database, but you can increase the logging by setting debug to 1,2 or 3
in NoMa.yaml (debugging will be to the file specified).  See 4.2.10 for further
details.

On receiving the command "status", the notifier will dump some basic statistics
to the statusfile.

Basic daemon functionality can be tested after "make"ing the code.
The test cases are in the t/ subdirectory and can be called with
perl t/test_name.t

7.2.1 Generating alerts by hand
--------------------------------

If nothing seems to be working then you should try the following;

# Alter the debug section in the NoMa.yaml configuration file and set the logging
level to 3
# su - to the nagios user 
# start NoMa with /path-to-noma/notifier/noma_daemon.pl --no-daemonize
# in another window generate an alert as follows;
/path-to-noma/notifier/alert_via_noma.pl -c s -s "WARNING" -H testhost -G "linux" -E "" -S "PING" -o "ping not ok" -n "PROBLEM" -a "hostalias" -i 127.0.0.1 -t $(date +%s) -u 2 -A "The admin" -C "" -R "admin"


7.3 Watchdog
-------------

Some versions of the perl threading implementation leak memory.  To prevent
this from getting out of hand there is a watchdog thread.  For configuration
details see 4.2.3

Be aware that a restart may cause pending retries (e.g. Voice alerts) to be lost.


7.4 Password reset
-------------------

If you forget the administrator password you can reset it in the database to 'nagiosadmin' -
the password is stored as a SHA1 hash - using the following SQL:

update contacts set admin=1,password='9e2b1592bd13bea759dab1e3011cab7ef47930cd' where username='nagiosadmin';
