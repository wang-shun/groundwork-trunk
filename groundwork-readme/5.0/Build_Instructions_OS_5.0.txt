1	PURPOSE
Important Note: The distributed Readme document should be reviewed prior to the installation or upgrade 
of GroundWork Monitor Open Source 5.0.

The purpose of the “Build Instructions” document is to describe the steps to build the GroundWork Monitor 
Open Source 5.0 product from source. Additionally, the documents “Installation”, “Readme”, and “Release 
Notes” include bug fixes and known issues; new features in this release; and an outline of system hardware 
requirements, pre-installation planning, and installation instructions, respectively. All documents are 
distributed in .txt and .pdf formats.

----------
2	BUILD ENVIRONMENT
Building GroundWork Monitor Open Source 5.0 from source requires preparing build environment, installing 
prerequisite software components, and executing the build script. Instructions are listed below and are also 
in the open source repository at this URL: http://archive.groundworkopensource.com/groundwork-
opensource/trunk/build/. Building GroundWork Monitor Open Source 5.0 from source requires preparing the 
build environment, installing prerequisite software components, and executing the build script. Note: 
Feedback is invited! Please post corrections and/or improvements to this document to the GroundWork 
Community Support Forums: http://www.groundworkopensource.com/community/forums/.

These steps describe how to set up the build environment. Currently, these instructions have been used to 
perform successful builds on the platforms listed below. Specialized instructions for a specific platform are 
denoted with the appropriate heading (e.g. CentOS4).
-	Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 (RHEL4)
-	CentOS 4.3 (CENTOS4) 32 bit
1.	The following packages must be installed before attempting a build of GroundWork Monitor Open 
Source:
-	gcc (3.4.3-9 or later) http://gcc.gnu.org/ 
-	gcc-c++ (3.4.3-9 or later) http://gcc.gnu.org/ 
-	glibc (3.4.3-9 or later) http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/glibc/ 
-	Java Development Toolkit (JDK) (1.5.0_05 or later) http://java.sun.com/
-	MySQL Database server (5.0.18 or later) http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/ 
-	Subversion (version 1.3 or later) http://subversion.tigris.org/project_packages.html 
-	ant (1.6.5 - get it from GroundWork - see below)
-	maven (1.0.2 - get it from GroundWork - see below)
To check the existing versions of these packages use the command rpm -qa | grep packagename. For 
example, to verify that these packages are installed and are of the correct version:
-	Execute this command to check gcc and gcc-c++
% rpm -qa |grep gcc

Expect this output:

gcc-3.4.3-9.EL4
libgcc-3.4.3-9.EL4
gcc-c++-3.4.3-9.EL4

-	Execute the following command to check glibc
% rpm -qa |grep glibc

Expect this output:

glibc-2.3.4-2
glibc-devel-2.3.4-2
glibc-headers-2.3.4-2
2.	Make sure that rpm-devel package is not installed as it conflicts with the libbeecrypt compilation. To 
verify that this package is not installed:
-	Execute this command to check rpm-devel:
% rpm -qa | grep rpm-devel

If you see this output:

rpm-devel-4.3.3-13_nonptl
(or any version of rpm-devel) you need to uninstall rpm-devel.

-	Execute this command to uninstall rpm-devel:
% rpm -e rpm-devel-4.3.3
(specify the version according to what you have installed)

3.	Install Java 5
-	Download and install JDK 1.5 from http://java.sun.com/. Install by following Sun's instructions 
for your platform.
-	Change the link in /etc/alternatives/java to point to the Java5 install 
/usr/java/jdk1.5.0_05/bin/java.
4.	Install MySQL 5.0
RHEL4
-	Red Hat installs some MySQL4 packages. You can identify the versions of the packages with 
the command rpm -qa | grep -i mysql.
-	To uninstall run this command, replacing xx with the version identified above:
      rpm -e mysql-client-xx cyrus-sasl-sql-2.1.19-5.EL4.i386
-	Download the MySQL rpm files from the MySQL web site, http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/. 
The packages are:
MySQL-server-standard
MySQL-client-standard
MySQL-shared-standard
MySQL-devel-standard

If you put all the files into the same temporary directory, rpm can install them all, in the right 
order, with a single command:
cd /tmp/mysql
rpm -Uvh MySQL-*
CENTOS4
-	Download the CentOS-specific MySQL 5 packages available at 
http://mirror.centos.org/centos/4/centosplus/i386/RPMS/.
-	You need the following files, installed in this order:
mysqlclient14-4.1.14-4.2.c4.1.i386.rpm
mysql-5.0.22-1.centos.1.i386.rpm (you may need the CentOS Install Disk 1 in the CD 
drive)
mysql-server-5.0.22-1.centos.1.i386.rpm
-	Check for the proper installation of these files using rpm -qa, for example:
rpm -qa | grep -i mysql

expect this output:

mysql-server-5.0.22-1.centos.1
mysqlclient14-4.1.14-4.2.c4.1
mysql-5.0.22-1.centos.1
perl-DBD-MySQL-2.9004-3.1
5.	Modify /etc/hosts
-	Make sure that localhost entry in /etc/hosts is valid:
127.0.0.1    localhost localhost.localdomain
Note that the "localhost" is *before* the "localhost.localdomain".
6.	Install Apache Runtime Utilities (apr) Subversion
-	Use the RPM install:
apr-util-0.9.4-17.i386.rpm &
subversion-1.3.2-1.rhel4.i386.rpm
7.	Configure ldconfig
-	Note that the build has to be run as root. This is because some of the components execute the 
ldconfig command.
-	Edit /etc/ld.so.conf and add /usr/local/groundwork/lib as the first line. Run ldconfig.
8.	Install ant and maven
-	GroundWork uses the 1.0.2 version of maven. You can get the right versions of these tools from 
our repository:
wget -c ftp://archive.groundworkopensource.com/pub/groundwork-core/build/*
-	untar files into an appropriate location, such as:
/usr/local/ant
/usr/local/maven
9.	Update the .bash_profile
-	Note that the build has to be run as root. This is because some of the components execute the 
ldconfig command.
-	These environment variables must be set for the user running the build, in the .bash_profile, 
for example:
export GW_HOME=/usr/local/groundwork
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/java/jdk1.5.0_05
export ANT_HOME=/home/nagios/apache/apache-ant-1.6.5
export MAVEN_HOME=/home/nagios/apache/maven-1.0.2
export LDFLAGS=-L$GW_HOME/lib
export LD_RUN_PATH=$GW_HOME/lib:$LD_RUN_PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$GW_HOME/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export CPPFLAGS=-I$GW_HOME/include
export 
PATH=$GW_HOME/bin:$PATH:$MAVEN_HOME/bin:$ANT_HOME/bin:$JAVA_HOME/bin
-	Confirm all paths and versions are correct: the build does do a pre-flight check and will abort 
early if it can't find a necessary build component.
----------
3.	EXECUTE THE BUILD
1.	Invoke the master_build.sh script:
2.	Make sure you are root. Then execute these commands:
# mkdir /home/nagios
# cd /home/nagios
# svn co http://archive.groundworkopensource.com/groundwork-opensource/trunk \
   groundwork-monitor
# cd groundwork-monitor/build
# nohup ./master-build.sh &
3.	It can take a couple of hours to build. You can keep an eye on things by tailing the output:
# tail -f nohup.out
4.	The master_build.sh script will build all of the components, deploy them into /usr/local/groundwork, 
and will build an RPM for Red Hat.
5.	Find the RPM in (e.g. /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386/groundwork-monitor-os-5.0-xx.rhel4.i386.rpm).
6.	See the section 7 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS below for information about how to install the RPM.
Note: The RPM should not be installed in the same environment where it was built. This is because the 
installation procedure will clobber some of the components of the build.
