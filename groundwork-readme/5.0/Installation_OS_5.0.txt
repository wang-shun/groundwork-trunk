2	PREREQUISITES
Supported Operating Systems
The GroundWork Monitor Open Source 5.0 RPM-based installer enables all components to be installed 
together on standard versions of commercial Linux. GroundWork adds supported distributions only after 
rigorous testing. These supported operating systems are recommended for stability and performance 
reasons. We highly recommend placing GroundWork Monitor Open Source on a dedicated server to 
ensure adequate performance, especially if there are a large number of devices to monitor via polling.
Current Supported OS for 32-bit Machines
GroundWork Monitor Open Source currently runs on Linux and supports the following Operating 
Systems running on 32-bit. See the list below for future OS support for 32-bit and 64-bit machines.
-	Red Hat Linux Enterprise WS 4.0 32 bit
-	Red Hat Linux Enterprise ES 4.0 32 bit
-	SuSE Linux Enterprise Server 9.x 32 bit
-	SuSE Linux Enterprise Server 10.1 32 bit

----------
3	PREREQUISITE INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION
Installation of GroundWork Monitor Open Source 5.0 from an RPM or Package requires preparing the 
installation environment, installing prerequisite software components, and following the installation 
procedure. Instructions are listed below and are also in the open source repository at this URL: 
http://archive.groundworkopensource.com/groundwork-opensource/trunk/build/.
Step 1 - SE Linux Configuration
The SE Linux package interferes with MySQL installation and must be disabled. It can be re-enabled after 
installing MySQL.
1.	Edit the /etc/selinux/config file so that it looks like:
# This file controls the state of SELinux on the system. 
# SELINUX= can take one of these three values: 
# enforcing - SELinux security policy is enforced. 
# permissive - SELinux prints warnings instead of enforcing. 
# disabled - SELinux is fully disabled.
SELINUX=disabled
# SELINUXTYPE= type of policy in use. Possible values are: 
# targeted - Only targeted network daemons are protected. 
# strict - Full SELinux protection. 
#SELINUXTYPE=targeted
2.	If you change these settings you may need to reboot your system before installing MySQL.
-----
Step 2 - Perl-DBI Installation
GroundWork Monitor Open Source requires Perl-DBI-1.40-5.i386.rpm to be installed on Red Hat and 
CentOS servers prior to MySQL. To download Perl DBI 1.40-5 i386 for Linux select this link 
http://rpmfind.net/linux/RPM/fedora/3/i386/perl-DBI-1.40-5.i386.html.
-----
Step 3 - MySQL Configuration
GroundWork Monitor Open Source requires the following packages (version 5.0.18 or higher) to be 
installed on the system. If you are not sure if the correct version of the packages is installed, query the 
RPM database for each package using rpm -qa |grep MySQL. 

Note: Upgrading an existing MySQL 4.x installation can cause the MySQL engine start to fail. 
Configuration settings for MySQL 4.x might be incompatible with MySQL 5.0. If MySQL doesn't start 
(server error) check if an old my.cnf file exists in /etc directory. Simply remove or rename the file and 
MySQL will start (/etc/init.d/mysql restart).
Downloading MySQL Pro (version 5.0.18 or higher)
You can download MySQL Pro 5.0.18-0 at http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/.
-	MySQL-server
-	MySQL-client
-	MySQL-shared-compat
-	MySQL-shared-pro
Installing MySQL Pro
You can install these packages by copying the appropriate MySQL rpm files for your operating system 
and issuing the command rpm -Uvh MySQL*. This will install the MySQL packages in the correct 
order.
Database Access
The installer needs root access for creating new databases and setting the permissions. If your root 
password for MySQL is empty (not recommended, but is the default after installing MySQL) no further 
MySQL configuration is needed and you can proceed with the installation step. If a root password has 
been specified you can pass it to the installer by setting an environment variable.

Important Note: If you use a root password for MySQL it needs to be provided to the RPMs that 
perform the installation. Prior to launching any RPM commands you need to set the value of the 
MySQL root password as following:
1.	Create an environment variable MYSQL_ROOT (all UPPERCASE) with the password value 
(e.g. export MYSQL_ROOT=password).
2.	Set the root password as described in the below example:
from command prompt# export MYSQL_ROOT=test
-----
Step 5 - Network Configuration
MySQL uses the localhost file on /etc/hosts. Make sure that the localhost entry looks like the example 
below. Also, make sure that localhost is first after the IP address followed by localhost.localdomain. 
Replace 192.168.2.100 with the IP address of the system, and groundworkserver with the real Host 
name.

127.0.0.1 localhost localhost.localdomain
192.168.2.100 groundworkserver groundworkserver.mycompany.com 

Example: groundworkserver.mycompany.com is the full qualified domain name where the 
GroundWork Monitor server is installed. Also, make sure TCP port 3306 is not blocked by your firewall 
rules. This port is for communication to MySQL server.
----------
4	NEW INSTALLATION
Installation of GroundWork Monitor Open Source means installing the software in a new, clean 
environment where there isn’t any pre-existing GroundWork Monitor data. This install package implements 
all GroundWork Monitor Open Source components in 1 RPM:
1.	OS RPM: groundwork-monitor-osv-5.0.y-yy.zzzz.zzzz.rpm
Important Note: Throughout the installation instructions the actual file names structure may vary 
depending on the particular product edition, version, build, and platform as describe here in our example:
Example Files:
-	OS RPM: groundwork-monitor-os-5.0.1-70.rhel4.i386.rpm
Example Structure: g r o u n d w o r k - r p m - w w - x . x . y - y y . z z z z . z z z z 
-	groundwork is the common prefix.
-	rpm is the RPM type; foundation (Foundation), monitor (Core), monitor (PRO)
-	ww is the GroundWork Monitor Edition; Open Source (os), Small Business (sb), or 
Professional (pro) Note: The Core RPM uses core as its GroundWork Monitor Edition.
-	x.x is the version number; Foundation 1.5, GroundWork 5.0.
-	y-yy represents the build number; Foundation RPM 1-59, Core RPM 1-41, PRO RPM 1-70.
-	zzzz.zzzz is the platform; Red Hat rhel4.i386 or SuSE sles9.
-----
Downloading the RPMs
You can download GroundWork Monitor Open Source 5.0 at 
http://www.groundworkopensource.com/downloads/mon_download.html. After the download, untar using 
the command tar -xzvf GroundWorkMonitorOS_5.0.tar which extracts the RPM.
Installing the Package
1.	To perform the installation you need to be root on the system.
2.	This installation places all files in the directory /usr/local/groundwork.
3.	GroundWork's version of Apache is installed with this package. If you are running Apache on your 
system, it will be stopped during the installation process, but not removed. Any content served will 
be served by the GroundWork version of Apache, but you should be aware that patches applied 
using the usual patch distribution systems will not be applied to the running version of Apache.
4.	The GroundWork Monitor Open Source package should be installed on a standalone system to 
avoid this scenario.
5.	Install the RPM by entering the following command:
OS RPM: This will install GroundWork Monitor Open Source version components. 
rpm -Uvh groundwork-monitor-osv-5.0.y-yy.zzzz.zzzz.rpm
-----

5.	Install the RPMs by following these steps in sequence and verifying that there are no errors after 
each one is complete:
OS RPM. This will install GroundWork Monitor Open Source version components.
rpm -Uvh groundwork-monitor-osv-5.0.y-yy.zzzz.zzzz.rpm 
-----
Uninstalling the Package
Important Note: rpm -e removes all traces of GroundWork Monitor, including any config files. You should 
back up all the RRDs, config files, and log files at a minimum if you want to keep these around. It is good 
practice to do this whenever performing a software install.
1.	To check which version you have installed, enter the command:
rpm -qa | grep groundwork.
2.	Once you know your current installed version, enter the following command for the appropriate 
package:
rpm -e groundwork-monitor- w w-x.x.y-yy.zzzz.zzzz
-----
Accessing GroundWork Monitor Open Source 5.0
1.	Go to the URL http://<hostaddress>/.
2.	The default Administrator User ID and Password is admin/admin. Use this ID to define Users, 
Groups, Roles, and Packages.
3.	The Administrator role also provides access to the Configuration option, which allows you to 
configure the Nagios monitoring system.
4.	An Operator role is pre-defined for you (Operator User ID and password is joe/joe) with access 
to GroundWork Monitor Open Source applications such as Status, Reports, and Bookshelf. 
Nagios files are installed in the following directories:
-	Binaries: /usr/local/groundwork/nagios/bin
-	Configuration: /usr/local/groundwork/nagios/etc
-	Eventhandlers: /usr/local/groundwork/nagios/eventhandlers
-	Plugins: /usr/local/groundwork/nagios/libexec
-	Share: /usr/local/groundwork/nagios/share
-	Logs: /usr/local/groundwork/nagios/var
-	Command: /usr/local/groundwork/nagios/var/spool
-	CGIs: /usr/local/groundwork/apache2/cgi-bin
----------
5	MIGRATING FROM AN EXISTING NAGIOS INSTALLATION TO A NEW GROUNDWORK SERVER
Basic Method
The steps below will show you how to set up a GroundWork Server and import an existing Nagios 
configuration.
1.	Copy the existing Nagios configuration files to /usr/local/groundwork/nagios/etc.
2.	Adjust the paths in nagios.cfg and nagios.cgi to /usr/local/groundwork/nagios/etc.
3.	For example, if your Nagios cfgs files are in /usr/local/nagios/etc, you just need the files 
referenced in your nagios.cfg and the cgi.cfg. Nothing else. Put them in 
/usr/local/groundwork/nagios/etc. Adjust the path in the nagios.cfg and the cgi.cfg. Be sure 
they are owned by Nagios (chown nagios.nagios *.cfg) so that the load can read them.
4.	Log into GroundWork Monitor Open Source as an Administrator (admin/admin).
5.	Click the Application Launcher and select the Configuration option.
6.	Confirm your configuration by loading the Nagios configuration, select Control>Load.
7.	Next, select Pre Flight Test, and then Commit.
----------
6	VERIFYING THE OPERATION OF GROUNDWORK MONITOR OPEN SOURCE
Checking Nagios Operations
The following process is only valid if the Single Sign On option of the Guava PHP framework is disabled 
for Nagios. This feature is enabled by default and prevents access to Nagios except from the GroundWork 
Monitor Open Source login. If you have disabled the Single Sign On, you can access Nagios with the 
following procedure.
1.	Open a browser to the Nagios URL http://<hostname>/nagios/.
2.	Check to see that the Nagios page appears.
3.	Select Service Detail. You should see the local Host monitoring Services.
-----
Checking Guava Framework
1.	Point your browser to http://YOUR_SERVER/.
2.	Log into GroundWork Monitor Open Source as an Operator (joe/joe).
3.	Click the Application Launcher and select the Status option. 
4.	Review the Overview status page.
5.	Select the NetView menu option.
6.	Open the Host and Service information. Check that the status information matches the Nagios 
status detail page. If the status detail does not match, go to the next step.
7.	Click the Application Launcher and select the Console option. 
8.	Check to see if Nagios console messages are appearing.
-----
Checking the connection between Nagios and GroundWork Foundation
1.	If the Status Viewer status and Nagios Service detail do not match, check the following:
-	Check to see if the nagios2collage_status.pl is executing with the following command:
ps -ef | grep nagios2collage.
-	If this process is not running, restart gwservices with the following command: 
/etc/init.d/gwservices restart.
2.	If the Console events do not appear, check the following:
-	Check to see if the nagios2collage_event.pl is executing with the following command: 
ps -ef | grep nagios2collage.
-	If this process is not running, restart gwservices with the following command: 
/etc/init.d/gwservices restart.
-----
Checking SNMPTRAP operation
The GroundWork Monitor Open Source server is by default enabled as a SNMP trap receiver. The SNMP 
trap (snmptrapd) and the SNMP trap translator or daemons must be running. To check these, issue the 
command ps -ef | grep snmp. You should see the following processes:
-	/usr/local/groundwork/sbin/snmptrapd -On -C -c 
/usr/local/groundwork/etc/snmp/snmptrapd.conf -Lf 
/usr/local/groundwork/var/log/snmp/snmptrapd.log
-	/usr/local/groundwork/bin/perl /usr/local/groundwork/sbin/snmptt --daemon --ini 
/usr/local/groundwork/etc/snmp/snmptt.ini
In order for GroundWork Monitor Open Source to process traps, the MIBs from the originating devices 
must be defined to the SNMP trap translator. To import MIBs, follow the instructions in section SNMP Trap 
Processing, Importing Device MIBs in Bookshelf. SNMP trap events received by GroundWork Monitor 
Open Source will show in the Console application.
To test this, you can send a test trap to the console with the following command. This will send a generic 
cold start trap.
-	snmptrap -v 1 -c public localhost "" "" 0 0 ""
If you are not receiving traps, check the following:
-	The SNMP trap receiver port 162 must be open. Ensure the firewall rules on the GroundWork 
Monitor Open Source server open this port. To see the iptable settings to allow this, reference 
the file /usr/local/groundwork/etc/iptables.
-	The MIB configuration may not allow this trap to be processed. To see all traps received, whether 
they are defined or not, check the snmptrapd log file name.
You can trace the progress of trap processing by looking at the following log files:
-	/usr/local/groundwork/var/log/snmp/snmptrapd.log
All SNMP traps received by the snmptrapd daemon.
-	/usr/local/groundwork/var/log/snmp/snmpttunknown.log
All traps not recognized by snmptt.  If your trap is recorded in this log, the MIB may not be 
imported into snmptt.
-	/usr/local/groundwork/var/log/snmp/snmptt.debug
Traps received and translated by snmptt daemon, and commands executed.
-	/usr/local/groundwork/var/log/snmp/gwprocesstrap.log
Traps processed and inserted into the GroundWork Foundation database.
----------
