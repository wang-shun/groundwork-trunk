----------
3	PREREQUISITE INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION
Step 1 - Java Installation
Java is required, careful attention must be paid to the steps needed to properly configure the environment, 
specifically the JAVA_HOME and PATH environment variables. The typical Java Development Kit 
distribution comes as a bin file from Sun Microsystems. You can download the build 06 Sun JAVA SDK 
1.5.0-06 i586 for Linux from this link 
http://www.groundworkopensource.com/downloads/JAVA/jdk-1_5_0_06-linux-i586-
rpm.bin. Note: You must login to the GroundWork Support Center at 
http://www.groundworkopensource.com/support/index.html to download from this link. If you 
try to download the file directly, without logging into the Support Center first, you will receive an access 
denied error. Or go to the Sun Microsystems site at http://www.sun.com/ for the latest build.
1.	Copy the file into a temporary folder on your hard disk.  Change directory to that folder.
2.	Make the file executable with the command: chmod+x <filename>
3.	Make sure you are root.
4.	Execute the binary file which will extract and install the rpm file by running the following command:
./jdk-1_5_0_06-linux-i586-rpm.bin
5.	You will be prompted to accept the license.
6.	The installer puts all files into: /usr/java
7.	Set the environment variable: JAVA_HOME
You will need to add the following two environment variables to: /etc/profile
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/java/jdk1.5.0_06
export PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin
Update the session environment variables by running the following command:
source /etc/profile
8.	In most Linux systems /usr/bin/java is a link to /etc/alternatives/java which is another 
link to the java executable. If this is the case you will need to update 
/etc/alternatives/java so that it points to your installation of the Java SDK command.  
Execute the following commands:
	ln -sf $JAVA_HOME/bin/java /etc/alternatives/java
		ln -sf /etc/alternatives/java /usr/bin/java
	
-----
Step 2 - SE Linux Configuration
The SE Linux package interferes with MySQL installation and must be disabled. It can be re-enabled after 
installing MySQL.
1.	Edit the /etc/selinux/config file so that it looks like:
# This file controls the state of SELinux on the system. 
# SELINUX= can take one of these three values: 
# enforcing - SELinux security policy is enforced. 
# permissive - SELinux prints warnings instead of enforcing. 
# disabled - SELinux is fully disabled.
SELINUX=disabled
# SELINUXTYPE= type of policy in use. Possible values are: 
# targeted - Only targeted network daemons are protected. 
# strict - Full SELinux protection. 
#SELINUXTYPE=targeted
2.	If you change these settings you may need to reboot your system before installing MySQL.
-----
Step 3 - Perl-DBI Installation
GroundWork Monitor Small Business requires Perl-DBI-1.40-5.i386.rpm to be installed on Red Hat and 
CentOS servers prior to MySQL. To download Perl DBI 1.40-5 i386 for Linux select this link 
http://www.groundworkopensource.com/downloads/files/mysql/perl-DBI-1.40-5.i386.rpm. 
Note: You must login to the GroundWork Support Center at 
http://www.groundworkopensource.com/support/index.html to download from this link. If you 
try to download the file directly, without logging into the Support Center first, you will receive an access 
denied error.


-----
Step 4 - MySQL Configuration
MySQL 5 is distributed with GroundWork Monitor Small Business, and is licensed as a commercial 
package. GroundWork Monitor Small Business does not install unless the commercial MySQL release is 
installed. Installing GroundWork Monitor Small Business will not delete any existing databases, and 
uninstalling will leave all databases alone, even the GroundWork databases. GroundWork Monitor Small 
Business requires the following packages (version 5.0.18 or higher) to be installed on the system. You 
must upgrade MySQL to the MySQL PRO version. If you are not sure if the correct version of the 
packages is installed, query the RPM database for each package using rpm -qa |grep MySQL.

Note: Upgrading an existing MySQL 4.x installation can cause the MySQL engine to fail to start. 
Configuration settings for MySQL 4.x might be incompatible with MySQL 5.0. If MySQL doesn't start 
(server error) check if an old my.cnf file exists in /etc directory. Simply remove or rename the file and 
MySQL will start (/etc/init.d/mysql restart).
Downloading MySQL Pro (version 5.0.18 or higher)
1.	Login to the Support Portal at http://www.groundworkopensource.com/support/.
2.	Select the link Downloads>>.
3.	Under GroundWork Monitor Releases, select the link for the GroundWork Monitor product you 
are using (e.g. Small Business 5.0, Small Business 5.0).
4.	Next, under the displayed platforms (e.g. RHEL4, SES9) select 32 or 64 bit.
5.	Under the Solutions section select the link for MySQL Pro.
6.	The links to the required RPMs will be listed. Select to download.
Installing MySQL Pro
1.	You can install these packages by copying the appropriate MySQL rpm files for your 
operating system and issuing the command rpm -Uvh MySQL*. This will install the MySQL 
packages in the correct order.
Database Access
The installer needs root access for creating new databases and setting the permissions. If your root 
password for MySQL is empty (not recommended, but is the default after installing MySQL) no further 
MySQL configuration is needed and you can proceed with the installation step. If a root password has 
been specified you can pass it to the installer by setting an environment variable.

Important Note: If you use a root password for MySQL it needs to be provided to the RPMs that 
perform the installation. Prior to launching any RPM commands you need to set the value of the 
MySQL root password as following:
1.	Create an environment variable MYSQL_ROOT (all UPPERCASE) with the password value 
(e.g. export MYSQL_ROOT=password).
2.	Set the root password as described in the below example:
from command prompt# export MYSQL_ROOT=test
-----
Step 5 - Network Configuration
MySQL uses the localhost file on /etc/hosts. Make sure that the localhost entry looks like the example 
below. Also, make sure that localhost is first after the IP address followed by localhost.localdomain. 
Replace 192.168.2.100 with the IP address of the system, and groundworkserver with the real Host 
name.

127.0.0.1 localhost localhost.localdomain
192.168.2.100 groundworkserver groundworkserver.mycompany.com 

Example: groundworkserver.mycompany.com is the full qualified domain name where the 
GroundWork Monitor server is installed. Also, make sure TCP port 3306 is not blocked by your firewall 
rules. This port is for communication to MySQL server.
----------
4	NEW INSTALLATION

-----
Installing the Package
1.	To perform the installation you need to be root on the system.
2.	This installation places all files in the directory /usr/local/groundwork.
3.	A GroundWork supplied version of Apache is installed with this package. If you are running Apache 
on your system, it will be stopped during the installation process, but not removed. Any content 
served will be served by the GroundWork version of Apache, but you should be aware that 
patches applied using the usual patch distribution systems will not be applied to the running 
version of Apache.
4.	The GroundWork Monitor Small Business package should be installed on a standalone system to 
avoid this scenario.
5.	Install the RPMs by following these steps in sequence and verifying that there are no errors after 
each one is complete:
1.	Foundation RPM. This will install the GroundWork Foundation components.
rpm -Uvh groundwork-foundation-pro-1.5.y-yy.noarch.rpm
2.	Core RPM. This will install GroundWork Monitor components.
rpm -Uvh groundwork-monitor-core-5.0.y-yy.zzzz.zzzz.rpm
-----
Accessing GroundWork Monitor Small Business 5.0
1.	Go to the URL http://<hostaddress>/.
2.	The default Administrator User ID and Password is admin/admin. Use this ID to define Users, 
Groups, Roles, and Packages.
3.	The Administrator role also provides access to the Configuration option, which allows you to 
configure the Nagios monitoring system.
4.	An Operator role is pre-defined for you (Operator User ID and password is joe/joe) with access to 
GroundWork Monitor Small Business applications such as Status, Reports, and Bookshelf. 
Nagios files are installed in the following directories:

-	Share: /usr/local/groundwork/nagios/share
-	Logs: /usr/local/groundwork/nagios/var
-	Command: /usr/local/groundwork/nagios/var/spool
-	CGIs: /usr/local/groundwork/apache2/cgi-bin
-----
Uninstalling the Package
Important Note: rpm -e removes all traces of GroundWork Monitor, including any config files. You should 
back up all the RRDs, config files, and log files at a minimum if you want to keep these around. It is good 
practice to do this whenever performing a software install.
1.	To check which version you have installed, enter the command:
rpm -qa | grep groundwork.
2.	Once you know your current installed version, enter the following command for the appropriate 
package:
rpm -e groundwork-monitor- w w-x.x.y-yy.zzzz.zzzz
----------
5	MIGRATING FROM AN EXISTING NAGIOS INSTALLATION TO A NEW GROUNDWORK SERVER
Basic Method
The steps below will show you how to set up a GroundWork Server and import an existing Nagios 
configuration.
1.	Copy the existing Nagios configuration files to /usr/local/groundwork/nagios/etc.
2.	Adjust the paths in nagios.cfg and nagios.cgi to /usr/local/groundwork/nagios/etc.
3.	For example, if your Nagios cfgs files are in /usr/local/nagios/etc, you just need the files 
referenced in your nagios.cfg and the cgi.cfg. Nothing else. Put them in 
/usr/local/groundwork/nagios/etc. Adjust the path in the nagios.cfg and the cgi.cfg. Be sure 
they are owned by Nagios (chown nagios.nagios *.cfg) so that the loader can read them.
4.	Log into GroundWork Monitor Small Business as an Administrator (admin/admin).
5.	Click the Application Launcher and select the Configuration option.
6.	Confirm your configuration by loading the Nagios configuration, select Control>Load.
7.	Next, select Pre Flight Test, and then Commit.
----------
6	VERIFYING THE OPERATION OF GROUNDWORK MONITOR SMALL BUSINESS
Checking the User Interface Framework 
1.	Point your browser to http://YOUR_SERVER/.
2.	Log into GroundWork Monitor Small Business as an Operator (joe/joe).
3.	Click the Application Launcher and select the Status option. 
4.	Review the Overview status page.
5.	Select the NetView menu option.
6.	Open the Host and Service information. Check that the status information is correct.
7.	Click the Application Launcher and select the Console option. 
8.	Check to see if Console messages are appearing.
9.	
----

Checking the connection between Nagios and GroundWork Foundation
1.	If the Status Viewer status and Nagios Service detail do not match, check the following:
-	Check to see if the nagios2collage_status.pl is executing with the following command:
ps -ef | grep nagios2collage.
-	If this process is not running, restart gwservices with the following command: 
/etc/init.d/gwservices restart.
2.	If the Console events do not appear, check the following:
-	Check to see if the nagios2collage_event.pl is executing with the following command: 
ps -ef | grep nagios2collage.
-	If this process is not running, restart gwservices with the following command: 
/etc/init.d/gwservices restart.
-----
Checking SNMPTRAP operation
The GroundWork Monitor Small Business server is by default enabled as a SNMP trap receiver. The 
SNMP trap (snmptrapd) and the SNMP trap translator or daemons must be running. To check these, 
issue the command ps -ef | grep snmp. You should see the following processes:
-	/usr/local/groundwork/sbin/snmptrapd -On -C -c 
/usr/local/groundwork/etc/snmp/snmptrapd.conf -Lf 
/usr/local/groundwork/var/log/snmp/snmptrapd.log
-	/usr/local/groundwork/bin/perl /usr/local/groundwork/sbin/snmptt --daemon --ini 
/usr/local/groundwork/etc/snmp/snmptt.ini
In order for GroundWork Monitor Small Business to process traps, the MIBs from the originating devices 
must be defined to the SNMP trap translator. To import MIBs, follow the instructions in section SNMP Trap 
Processing, Importing Device MIBs in Bookshelf. SNMP trap events received by GroundWork Monitor 
Small Business will show in the Console application.
To test this, you can send a test trap to the console with the following command. This will send a generic 
cold start trap.
-	snmptrap -v 1 -c public localhost "" "" 0 0 ""
If you are not receiving traps, check the following:
-	The SNMP trap receiver port 162 must be open. Ensure the firewall rules on the GroundWork 
Monitor Small Business server open this port. To see the iptable settings to allow this, reference 
the file /usr/local/groundwork/etc/iptables.
-	The MIB configuration may not allow this trap to be processed. To see all traps received, whether 
they are defined or not, check the snmptrapd log file name.
You can trace the progress of trap processing by looking at the following log files:
-	/usr/local/groundwork/var/log/snmp/snmptrapd.log
All SNMP traps received by the snmptrapd daemon.
-	/usr/local/groundwork/var/log/snmp/snmpttunknown.log
All traps not recognized by snmptt.  If your trap is recorded in this log, the MIB may not be 
imported into snmptt.
-	/usr/local/groundwork/var/log/snmp/snmptt.debug
Traps received and translated by snmptt daemon, and commands executed.
-	/usr/local/groundwork/var/log/snmp/gwprocesstrap.log
Traps processed and inserted into the GroundWork Foundation database.
----------
7	UPGRADING FROM PREVIOUS VERSIONS
