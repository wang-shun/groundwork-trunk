--------------------
SECTION 1 - KNOWN ISSUES
--------------------
This section includes a description of the known issues in this release
of GroundWork Monitor Open Source.

1. Installing and uninstalling the individual groundwork rpms is not
advised.
To install or uninstall GroundWork Monitor Open Source, please follow
the instructions in "GroundWork Monitor Open Source 5.1.3
Installation Guide".

2. Uninstalling individual Application Packages within the 
Administration package is not advised
The GroundWork Monitor default Application Packages should never be
uninstalled. The default Application Packages can be viewed from within
the Administration tab.  If a default package is removed, GroundWork 
Monitor will have to be reinstalled. This is due to a lack 
of cross-package dependency checking when a package is uninstalled.  
Moreover, there is no "confirm" message presented when removing packages.  

3. Insight Reports - the Availability Reports
Immediately following an installation, there will be no data for the
Availability Reports. The data for these reports are generated by the
dashboard_data_load.pl and dashboard_avail_load.pl scripts which are
normally run once a day, at night, as a cron job.  This is the 
expected behavior. These scripts can be run manually to generate data
earlier if required.  Please refer to the Bookshelf for further 
documentation under the Administrator's Guide, Section 6, chapter 4 
Insight Reports.

4. Configuration application (Monarch) and Performance application
directories accessible via the browser
The file system directories of the Configuration application (Monarch)
and the Performance application are directly accessible via the browser.
These directories should not be accessed in this way.

5. Data elements can be modified by multiple users at the same time.
GroundWork Monitor Professional does not prevent multiple users from
simultaneously modifying the same data element.  Data elements include
dashboards, Configuration, Administration, Advanced Reports, hosts,
host groups, services, etc.

6. Session disconnect when the IP address changes
The GroundWork Monitor single sign on authentication credentials include
the user's current IP address. If the user's IP address were to change
while using the GroundWork Monitor product, the user can no longer be
authenticated and must sign back in. This event can occur with dynamic
IP addresses and a dropped VPN connection or if a network cable is
unplugged.

7. Upon installation, manual restart of gwservices, or system startup,
gwservices may not be fully initialized when users are first allowed to
log in.
To work around this issue, either wait 30 seconds to 1 minute before 
logging in or wait until gwservices status shows "running". 

8. When restarting /etc/init.d/gwservices service makes Web Service
components unresponsive in the browser.
In this release, gwservices runs and controls the entire middle ware
that includes the different feeders, the data integration engine and
the Web Service layer that drives the UI. It is not advised to just
restart the gwservices service since it puts UI components consuming
Web Services into an unknown state and the components no longer
respond in the browser. To synchronize the system it is
advised to stop all services used by GroundWork Monitor and restart
them in the order below. Make sure that all users are logged out of
the application before stopping/starting the services
Stopping the services
Stop Apache2 -- /etc/init.d/httpd stop
Stop Foundation -- /etc/init.d/gwservices stop 
Starting the services
Start Foundation -- /etc/init.d/gwservices start
Start Apache2 -- /etc/init.d/httpd start.

9. Limitation of 15 concurrent users 
For the GroundWork Monitor 5.1.3 release, we support up to 15 
concurrent users while maintaining acceptable performance.  With
more than 15 concurrent users on the system, slower performance may
be experienced and users may be logged out of the application. 
This issue will be fixed in a future release.

10. When restarting any of the services in /etc/init.d/, please make
sure that all users have logged out of the GroundWork server first.
The GroundWork Monitor services are:
nsca - starting and stopping the NSCA daemon.
nagios - services that stop and start Nagios
httpd - service used to stop and start Apache
gwservices - service used to stop and start GroundWork Monitor
services.
In most cases, stopping and starting any of the /etc/init.d/ 
services is not advised. These services are interdependent upon one
another. When these services are randomly started, the other 
services will be placed into unknown states. If you must stop and 
start one of these services have all users log out of the server 
first. Moreover in most cases, if an admin needs to stop one of 
these services, the safest course of action is to stop all the 
services and start them again thereby allowing all the Groundwork 
Monitor services to resynchronize with one another.  Note starting 
and stopping the nagios service also starts and stops the nsca 
service, starting and stopping the httpd, gwservices services 
should be done in the order documented above.

11. Installation error messages on the SuSE 9 Platform
During installation on the SuSE 9 platform, occasionally the 
following error messages may be written to the console:  
"Starting HTTP Server (98) Address already in use: make_sock: 
could not bind to address [::]:80 Error"  or "error: cannot 
get shared lock on /var/lib/rpm/Packages. Error: cannot open 
Packages index using db3 - Operation not permitted. 
Error: cannot open Packages database in /var/lib/rpm".  
This error messages can be ignored 

12. Wrappit Application does not support special characters
Use only alphanumeric characters within the Wrappit Application.

13. Administrator must delete the config-last.log file when 
importing an older version of monarch.sql.
If you load an older version dump of the Monarch database in to
5.1.3 you must delete 
/usr/local/groundwork/nagios/etc/config-last.log

14. Known issue in FireFox 2.x browser.
A known issue in the FireFox 2.x browser can cause pop-up windows 
to become visually corrupted. . This may occur when a new popup 
appears above an existing popup. The existing popup's contents 
may appear scrambled. The popup contents can be restored by 
refreshing the popup.

15. Insight Report Package error with the Outages Report
This a known issue in the Insight Report package when selecting 
the Outage Report option. The data query is not being displayed.

16. Foundation database causes long migration time
A known issue in the migration of Foundation package might take
up to an hour. The migration time for the Foundation database
varies depending on the size of the database especially the 
number Events stored in the LogMessage table. If a customer has
less than 50000 messages the migration time is below 5 minutes. 
The migration of Foundation with 200000 or more messages can take
over an hour. 
To determine the number of events open a command window and log
into MySQL. Select the database GWCollageDB and run the following
query: select count (*) from LogMessage.

17. Using port Http 8080 from an URL allows access to links 
without authentication
This is a known issue with Foundation package. By entering
http://groundworkserver:8080 brings up a web page that allows
access to these links without authentication.
http://gwserver:8080/reportserver/
http://gwserver:8080/birtviewer/
http://gwserver:8080/foundation-webapp/

18. Performance graphs won't be generated when renaming a service
with  special characters or spaces.
This is a known issue with Performance package only use alphanumeric
characters when renaming a service.

19. Installation error messages on the all platforms.
During installation on the all platforms, occasionally the 
following error messages may be written to the console:
"Setting up the permissions.../bin/chown: changing ownership of
`/usr/local/groundwork/lib/20060613/20060613': No such file or
directory".  This error messages can be ignored.
