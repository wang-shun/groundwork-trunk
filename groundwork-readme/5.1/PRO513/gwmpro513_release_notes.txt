--------------------
SECTION 1 – WHAT’S NEW IN GROUNDWORK MONITOR PROFESSIONAL 5.1.x
--------------------
GroundWork Monitor Professional is designed to provide 
centralized visibility and control over your entire IT infrastructure. It 
monitors systems, applications, databases, and network 
equipment. GroundWork Monitor Professional features a flexible 
architecture that supports custom configurations and custom 
reporting. The system is built on a modern architecture that 
combines the best of open source with innovative software 
developed by GroundWork's IT management experts for 
monitoring and managing your network availability and 
performance. New features in this version include:

Performance Improvements:
– We are seeing performance increases of 2x to 5x for data 
intensive screens.  In almost all cases the screens refresh 
within a couple of seconds.

– The improved Status Viewer allows users to quickly navigate 
to the information of interest, with fewer clicks, and a cleaner 
interface.

– With a more complete implementation of web services at the 
data retrieval level, all screens that access data from the 
Foundation database are more responsive.  This includes 
Status Viewer, Console, and Dashboards. 

Scalability:
– The product scales to 15 concurrent users, maintaining 
acceptable performance.

– Support for 500 hosts per monitoring server

– Support for 500 service checks per minute (5000 service 
checks total)

– Support for 6 child servers (total of 3000 hosts, 3000 service 
checks/minute)

Enhanced Status Viewer:
Optimized Display
– Eliminates redundant clicks to get to pertinent information 

– More efficiently structured to handle large datasets 

– More efficiently retrieves data and less memory required per 
user 

– Faster display by only retrieving visible information 
Host Search on all pages:

– Tree Navigation on all pages

– Navigate and expand tree to see status of all host groups, 
hosts and services 

– Pie charts to better visualize system state 

– Dual pane TroubleView 

– Independent scrolling of hosts and services 

– Bar graph indicates overall health of hosts and services 

Additional supported configurations:
– Seamless upgrade from GroundWork Monitor Open Source 
5.1.x to GroundWork Monitor Professional 5.1.x

– With version 5.1.x, the persistent data store is the same 
between the two products providing a seamless upgrade from 
Open Source to Professional.

with GroundWork Monitor Professional

--------------------
SECTION 2 – BEHAVIOR THAT HAS CHANGED IN VERSION 5.1.0
--------------------
– Support for Firefox 1.5.x dropped due to Security Issues
Support for Firefox 1.5.x has been dropped for GroundWork 
Monitor Professional 5.1.x because Firefox 1.5.x does not set 
the http referrer header for resource requests that are 
generated in javascript.  This opens up a security hole in 
accessing various applications such as Advanced Reports, 
Performance, etc.  The release does support Firefox 2.x and 
Internet Explorer 6 and 7.  
For customers that require Firefox 2.x, and are comfortable 
with the security exposure, the Configuration Guide for 
GroundWork Monitor Professional 5.1.x shows how to 
reconfigure version 5.1.x to work with Firefox 1.5.x.

– Logic used to determine Pending status for services
In GroundWork Monitor Professional 5.0 there was an 
inconsistency between how Nagios and GroundWork Monitor 
determined which services are “pending”.  The logic that 
Nagios uses (and GroundWork has adopted for version 5.1.x):
For either passive or active checks, look at the following fields 
in the status.log:

– If both the "has been checked" and "last checked" field are "0", 
then the service should be shown as "pending"

– If either the "has been checked” field is "1", or "last checked" 
is non-zero, then use the "current status" field to determine the 
service's status.

– Pending status in TroubleView
In the 5.0 version of the product, services that were in a 
pending state were shown in TroubleView.  With release 5.1.x, 
that is no longer the case.  This change was made because 
many of our customers have passive checks that may remain 
in a pending state for long periods of time, and consequently 
these services are not considered to be in trouble.

– Console suppresses columns with no data
When the console display is rendered, if an entire column to 
be displayed contains no data, then the column is hidden.  
This enhancement was made to make it easier to navigate the 
page, since some fields such as “acknowledged by” or 
“acknowledge comments” are commonly empty.  If the page 
subsequently is updated and the column gets data, the 
column is then displayed.  The redisplay can occur when 
either the user navigates through the console screens, or a 
currently displayed console screen is updated with new data.

– Status Viewer will move to the bottom of the main drop down 
menu when upgrading from a previous version of GroundWork 
Monitor Professional 
When an existing installation upgrades to version 5.1.x, the 
previous Status Viewer is removed and the enhanced Status 
Viewer application is installed.  This causes the new Status 
Viewer to show up at the bottom of the main drop down menu 
for existing users that have Status Viewer in their menu.  The 
position of Status Viewer on the drop down menu can be 
changed via the Administration tab. 

– Profiles need to be imported into the product
Previously, when a user installed the Professional product, all 
the prepackaged Profiles were pre-loaded into the system.  
With version 5.1.x, a user needs to import the Profiles into the 
product.  This behavior has been changed to avoid the 
situation where existing profiles are overwritten, losing any 
changes a user might have made to the previously installed 
profiles.  The steps to import the profiles are described in the 
online Bookshelf documentation in the Administrator’s Guide, 
Section 4, Chapter 4.

– FilterView has been removed from Status Viewer
With the Dashboard feature added in version 5.0, the 
functionality that FilterView provided can more easily be 
satisfied through dashboards.  With the enhanced Status 
Viewer, the FilterView has been removed.
To make the Console Widget behavior consistent between 
Status Viewer and Dashboards, the “De-activate Refresh” and 
“Sort Option” buttons have been removed from the Console 
Widget for Dashboards.

– Default polling time changed from 5 minutes to 10 minutes
The best practices recommendations from our Professional 
Services group is to actively poll the hosts and services on a 
10 minute interval, so the default polling time has been 
updated accordingly in the default settings of the product.

--------------------
SECTION 3 – BEHAVIOR THAT HAS CHANGED IN VERSION 5.1.3
--------------------
-  TroubleView suppresses display of services on hosts that
are down
To avoid crowding the display and allow faster location of
problem hosts and services, the behavior of the TroubleView
has changed. Services in a non OK and non-pending state will
not be shown in the Troubled Services section of the display
if the hosts to which they are associated are down. Note that
this may result in the bar graph for Troubled Services showing
red and/or yellow for services in critical or warning states,
and yet none of these services may be listed. This is by design.
